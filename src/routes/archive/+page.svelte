    <p>
      The Dartmoor Trust Archive aims to provide a home for photos, video, and
      audio depicting life on Dartmoor. We have scanned tens of thousands of
      items and made them available to the public for free through this website.
      Our approach to preservation has been to capture these items to National
      Archive standards—these digital masters are then stored in multiple secure
      locations to ensure they are around for generations to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not store the original items. If you have a collection that you
      would like to add to the Archive, please contact us to find out more about
      our project. Where a copyright exists, it remains with the copyright
      holder—we can support you in getting the items digitized and, where
      desired, advise on finding a new physical home for the original items.
    </p>

    <Heading text="Using our items" level={2} />
    <p>
