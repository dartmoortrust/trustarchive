    <p>
      We welcome applications from groups or individuals who feel that their
      project will benefit Dartmoor, its people and environment. The amount of
      the grants is at the discretion of the Trustees. but will normally be less
      than £500 and no more than 50% of total costs, but more may be available
      for projects of particular merit. Dartmoor Trust Grants can provide the
      matching finance required to access funds from public and statutory
      bodies. The scheme is simple and flexible.
