00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:01.909
Testing

1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.250
track two of Dat 2,

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.159
on the 14th of November

3
00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:08.449
2001.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.970
Uh ready to record Ted Dixon this afternoon.

5
00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.609
Testing track 2 D 2.

6
00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:19.420
Right,

7
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.069
so let me just start by asking you what.

8
00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.000
You're just let's just confirm on tape what your name is.

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.090
Do you like to be called Bickets?

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110
Well,

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.060
my full name is Charles Edward Burkett Dixon.

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.919
Burkett was my father's wish because

13
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.659
he comes from Scottish descent.

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.000
Although he was born in

15
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.979
Lancashire,

16
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.540
he,

17
00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.680
he had Scottish descent and he

18
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.310
We're probably connected remotely to quite a few other people at a burkage,

19
00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.619
so.

20
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.810
It's,

21
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.229
uh,

22
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.790
I usually put on my notices I'll put Ted Bucket Dixon,

23
00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:53.270
but I like to be called Ted.

24
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:55.060
And what,

25
00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.310
where,

26
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.849
where,

27
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.099
um,

28
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.229
were you,

29
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.419
what,

30
00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:57.330
what's your date of birth?

31
00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.310
22nd of November 1923.

32
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.599
So it's nearly,

33
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.700
nearly your birthday.

34
00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:04.470
Yes,

35
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.169
I know.

36
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.059
So,

37
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:07.500
uh,

38
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.669
and where were you born then?

39
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.160
I was actually born at Weymouth in Dorset,

40
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.900
um,

41
00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:15.010
right opposite the king's statue next door to the

42
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.349
registrar of Births,

43
00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:17.410
ladies and deaths.

44
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.330
It was quite handy.

45
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:20.510
And later on that became a royal blue office,

46
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.000
so that was also handy.

47
00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.839
Um,

48
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.050
my father was in the navy we stationed at Portland.

49
00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.370
I was only there a couple of years and I came down.

50
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:31.410
Dad was posted down to,

51
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.330
oh you've got it on.

52
00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:34.419
Dad was posted down to um

53
00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:36.569
to uh Devonport.

54
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.849
Then he,

55
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.750
we had a flat,

56
00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:39.569
I can't remember it.

57
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.370
We had a flat in Keyham

58
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.930
while the house in Elberton was being built.

59
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.690
It was 1927.

60
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.180
And um I

61
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.099
either 1927 or 192928,

62
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.489
we moved out here

63
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.510
and I've lived here ever since.

64
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.470
You've lived here ever since,

65
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.930
so you were brought up in this household

66
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.370
you were brought up in this house or?

67
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.800
No,

68
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:00.230
no,

69
00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:01.709
I lived on Springfield Road.

70
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.410
My wife lived on Wembry Road

71
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.910
before we met.

72
00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.830
We met because we ran the scouts and guides.

73
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.788
I asked her once,

74
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.639
would she run,

75
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.289
run the cubs for me,

76
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.350
and that's how we got to know each other.

77
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.070
Um,

78
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.350
so when we moved,

79
00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:17.770
we got married,

80
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.580
um,

81
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.020
we used to scout trek cart

82
00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:21.949
because I moved 100 yards up here,

83
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.990
my wife used 100 yards that way.

84
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.070
And when was that,

85
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.779
when were you married?

86
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.410
Uh,

87
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.699
31st of May 1952,

88
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.869
the year before the Queen's coronation.

89
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.369
And

90
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.240
So tell me about your,

91
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.080
your childhood then.

92
00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.699
It was here in Elberton mainly.

93
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.119
Um,

94
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.479
yes,

95
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:37.759
yes,

96
00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:38.639
it was

97
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.800
wonderful days.

98
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.279
I mean,

99
00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.559
not regarding Dartmoor,

100
00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.240
but regarding Albert and it was the days when

101
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.649
You didn't have a house number.

102
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.539
Often the name,

103
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.880
just a name would be enough.

104
00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.059
The telephone number,

105
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.699
those who had the telephone were in two figures only,

106
00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:54.899
and um,

107
00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.880
It was.

108
00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.020
Probably hard days,

109
00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.479
although I didn't know it so much as my father

110
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.460
for money wise,

111
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.369
but um

112
00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.520
he was away a lot,

113
00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.270
so I only.

114
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.080
Saw him on his leaves,

115
00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:11.039
they'd be away of 5 years at a time in those days,

116
00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.320
you know,

117
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.360
no coming back in in between,

118
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.139
you just didn't know your father when he came back,

119
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.080
then,

120
00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.059
I remember the first bus coming

121
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.559
once a week.

122
00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.800
I remember the

123
00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.039
first electricity pylons going up.

124
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.089
Um,

125
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.059
the first bus.

126
00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:30.809
I don't know,

127
00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.229
it must have been

128
00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:33.250
sort of age?

129
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.889
It must have been about 11,

130
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.130
so it must have been a 34,

131
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.770
35,

132
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.949
it's in the thirties.

133
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.270
And we first electricity we had and they,

134
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.710
Two local farmers,

135
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.429
their cattle used to go up and down the road twice a day for milking.

136
00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.830
So that was traffic carbon in those days.

137
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.990
So you didn't have electricity when you first moved.

138
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.199
Oh,

139
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.300
no,

140
00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:52.500
no,

141
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:53.929
gas.

142
00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.820
Yes,

143
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.130
it was gas seemed to get right out into cornwood in the country

144
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.929
where

145
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.750
electricity hadn't reached.

146
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.630
But you have We had water,

147
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.949
yes,

148
00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.529
yes.

149
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.429
So do you know when electric came?

150
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:06.350
When did electric come?

151
00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.960
Not actually,

152
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.220
it must have been.

153
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.089
Couldn't have been many years before the war.

154
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.269
And how about cooking and what have you?

155
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.279
What did your mother need to,

156
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.350
did you cook,

157
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.200
cooking and heating?

158
00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:19.440
Oh,

159
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.260
it was a gas stove,

160
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.260
one of the old cast iron,

161
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.200
uh,

162
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.899
Plymouth

163
00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.940
and Stonehouse Gas Company,

164
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.600
and it was a crude old iron thing which we had for many years.

165
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.000
In fact,

166
00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.390
we,

167
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.839
we even brought it here until we had a better one.

168
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.399
Those were the days when you had earthenware sinks,

169
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.910
you know.

170
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.239
So,

171
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.510
um,

172
00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:39.690
did you have any brothers and sisters?

173
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.970
No,

174
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.359
I didn't.

175
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.750
So

176
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.029
I used to go back to Weymouth because

177
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.989
I was born in the house owned by my aunt and uncle,

178
00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:49.390
and they had,

179
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.470
William,

180
00:04:50.549 --> 00:04:51.529
which was my

181
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.269
cousin,

182
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.869
cousin,

183
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.570
that's right.

184
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.019
And um I used to go back and stay with them for a couple of weeks during the holidays,

185
00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.829
school holidays.

186
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.320
So,

187
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.829
so generally as a child it was just you and your mother at home,

188
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:02.230
is that right?

189
00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:02.670
That's right,

190
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.070
yes,

191
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.630
yes.

192
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.790
Where did you go to school?

193
00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:06.019
I went to school first.

194
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:08.750
I went to a little Kyle Preparatory School,

195
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.809
KYLE,

196
00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.820
um,

197
00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:11.809
that was at the back.

198
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.829
Of Pomflet,

199
00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:16.549
it's uh I think it's all gone now in an estate.

200
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.390
Then I went to Arreston Primary School,

201
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.470
that was my

202
00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:22.079
first real school.

203
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.190
That one's still there,

204
00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:24.450
very much the same.

205
00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:25.690
And uh,

206
00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.130
then from there I went to Plympton Grammar,

207
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.290
and then,

208
00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:33.920
I went into a technical college for a

209
00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:35.109
few weeks,

210
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.980
but most of the time I was drafted

211
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.880
then into filling sandbags down in Devonport College because

212
00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:41.410
there was no holidays,

213
00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:42.420
no school holidays,

214
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.040
you all had to do war work then.

215
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.290
So that was down there until I got

216
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.170
till I

217
00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.519
volunteered there

218
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.500
to have a choice because I was in the scouts,

219
00:05:51.609 --> 00:05:53.149
so I knew Morson semaphore.

220
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.959
So I,

221
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.380
I asked to go in the signals.

222
00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.260
So how long were you in the in the.

223
00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:59.380
Just over 5 years,

224
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.649
or about 5 years.

225
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.519
I joined up in the signals,

226
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.529
went up to Catterick.

227
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.670
So when would you have joined?

228
00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:10.950
1940 must have been the beginning of 1942.

229
00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:12.230
These are,

230
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.559
these are figures I

231
00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.480
must have been,

232
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.679
it was after the Blitz because I've got my,

233
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.720
I've got my 1941 diary with all the air raids and the aircraft I saw and everything.

234
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:25.329
So it must have been 1942.

235
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.070
So that took you took you away from Plymouth.

236
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.359
Yes,

237
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.859
right up to Scotland.

238
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.279
Um,

239
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.079
no,

240
00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:31.640
what was it,

241
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.230
Yorkshire,

242
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.559
wasn't it?

243
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.119
Catterick camp at Yorkshire.

244
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.950
Did my basic training.

245
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.790
Then I was posted down to the 53rd Welsh division,

246
00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:40.600
which was at

247
00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:42.720
Harriersham near Maidstone in Kent.

248
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.470
Uh,

249
00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.250
while I was there I took various signals exams.

250
00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:47.910
Then

251
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.250
I was posted to the,

252
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.269
a new branch which was signal security.

253
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.769
And we had to monitor our own people to make

254
00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:59.790
sure they weren't giving anything away and we had power to

255
00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.089
get on to brigadiers or whoever you like.

256
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.709
If they

257
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.329
made a mistake and then

258
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.950
gave away any information,

259
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.679
we could get onto them and slam them,

260
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.130
you see.

261
00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:12.500
So I went over to the Isle of Man on a 3 week training course

262
00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.059
and then came back.

263
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029
Then

264
00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:17.660
while I was down in Kent.

265
00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:20.750
One day I knew a lot about aircraft then

266
00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:24.190
one day I saw the first two Gloucester

267
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.000
P-434s.

268
00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:28.989
They were the first two experimental jet.

269
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.209
Nobody else on the camp knew what they were,

270
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.869
but I knew what they were right away

271
00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:34.829
because I'd heard about them so much.

272
00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.950
And they were the forerunners.

273
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:39.429
I suppose of a meteor really,

274
00:07:39.549 --> 00:07:40.750
but they were the first two.

275
00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:44.420
I don't think they actually did any shooting down the V1s at all,

276
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.570
but we were right on the corridor where all the V1s were

277
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.049
going over to London.

278
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.079
quite a,

279
00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:50.950
quite,

280
00:07:51.049 --> 00:07:51.890
quite a lot,

281
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.570
although I saw more abroad than I did there.

282
00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:55.489
But

283
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:56.100
um,

284
00:07:56.429 --> 00:07:57.230
so when you came,

285
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.029
you were in the army for,

286
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.820
for uh,

287
00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:00.429
for 5 years,

288
00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:00.709
did you?

289
00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:01.040
Yes,

290
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.429
just about 5 years.

291
00:08:02.529 --> 00:08:02.750
Then,

292
00:08:02.829 --> 00:08:03.170
uh,

293
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:03.799
of course

294
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:05.339
we were involved in the D-Day.

295
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.130
We did a big exercise and.

296
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:08.989
We all had wireless silence,

297
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.480
we weren't allowed to broadcast for quite a time.

298
00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:13.359
And then one day we drove,

299
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.279
we drove up,

300
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.619
we drove right through London,

301
00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:17.679
um Tilbury Docks.

302
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.989
We boarded the ships taking us in the landing craft to go across and what happened,

303
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.209
we had that big gale.

304
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:27.359
So we turned round with the tide for 3 or 4 days

305
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.099
and uh then eventually we landed over in France on uh D + 27,

306
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.020
so.

307
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.150
No it was it 27?

308
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.299
Yeah,

309
00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.210
I'm pretty sure it's D + 27.

310
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.070
So I've just been back this last summer for the first time.

311
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.530
That must have been quite an experience.

312
00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:46.039
Quite,

313
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.299
yes,

314
00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.159
some places I don't recognise but um

315
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.500
you know,

316
00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:51.140
it brought back a terrific lot of memories.

317
00:08:52.619 --> 00:08:52.679
I'm,

318
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.090
I'm sure.

319
00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:56.200
Let's get you back down back back to uh Plymouth.

320
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.510
When did you return back to I came back here in.

321
00:09:01.289 --> 00:09:03.469
I know it was my birthday

322
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.039
in 1946.

323
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.429
I was

324
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:10.989
shopping in Tripoli in Libya

325
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:13.969
and I was buying some oranges and I was buying some

326
00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:16.609
nuts and all of a sudden somebody dashed up and said,

327
00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:17.159
Quick,

328
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.809
you're wanted back,

329
00:09:17.849 --> 00:09:19.150
you're sailing this afternoon.

330
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:23.340
Yeah,

331
00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:23.830
I'd already,

332
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.219
I'd already taken a picture of a of a boat in the harbour,

333
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.159
not realising I should be on it.

334
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.520
Quickly getting all my kit together and coming home,

335
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.739
sailed across to Marseille and then up by railway through to

336
00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:39.039
through to Calais and then across the Channel

337
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.419
and um.

338
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.820
Of course I missed the boat a bit,

339
00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:46.359
all in between of course I went through to Holland,

340
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.229
um,

341
00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:48.080
and Germany,

342
00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:49.190
um,

343
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.119
then,

344
00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:54.849
I think we went to Aldershot for demobbing and we came straight home.

345
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.479
And of course I had about 3 months' leave to come or something.

346
00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.820
So I looked,

347
00:10:00.219 --> 00:10:01.479
looked around for a job then.

348
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:03.530
And then do you have any idea what you wanted to do?

349
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.320
Not at all.

350
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.679
Luckily out in Tripoli for a year.

351
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.390
Um,

352
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.530
I,

353
00:10:10.849 --> 00:10:11.349
I was

354
00:10:11.609 --> 00:10:16.140
nominated to go on the pay office and so I did all the pay for this squadron for.

355
00:10:17.309 --> 00:10:18.369
But a few months.

356
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.140
Um,

357
00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:20.830
made it.

358
00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:21.119
I mean,

359
00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:23.119
a lot of little things happened in between.

360
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.520
I used to go up in the hills.

361
00:10:24.849 --> 00:10:26.479
I used to go and see Roman ruins,

362
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.239
Seratus,

363
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.099
Leptic Leptis Magna.

364
00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:31.010
organise

365
00:10:32.219 --> 00:10:34.219
Table tennis matches between the

366
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.570
Jewish Maccabi club,

367
00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:36.619
the Italian club,

368
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.580
the German club,

369
00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:38.580
the prisoners of war,

370
00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:38.909
and

371
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:39.830
Oh,

372
00:10:39.869 --> 00:10:41.549
I got photographic club I was in.

373
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.780
Oh,

374
00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:42.390
I used to,

375
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.950
so you were an entertainment manager,

376
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.299
were you?

377
00:10:44.989 --> 00:10:45.659
unofficially,

378
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.859
yeah,

379
00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:46.090
yeah.

380
00:10:48.979 --> 00:10:52.229
In a way it's funny you look back and you remember the good things,

381
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.210
not the bad.

382
00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:54.359
Um.

383
00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:55.739
You know,

384
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.780
it's like you see Kabul today,

385
00:10:57.859 --> 00:10:58.380
all the people,

386
00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:58.859
I mean

387
00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:01.590
we were in Tripoli we had all those different people,

388
00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:03.830
ex-prisoners of war and all the lot.

389
00:11:03.979 --> 00:11:04.859
You could go out.

390
00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:08.400
I used to walk in the hills on my own with all the tribesmen around.

391
00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.229
No worry at all.

392
00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:11.489
But you come

393
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.469
this country today,

394
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.729
you're more worried here.

395
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:14.750
Yeah,

396
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:15.539
different times.

397
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.159
Terrible state of affairs.

398
00:11:17.669 --> 00:11:17.679
Yeah.

399
00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:20.080
So when you get back to Plymouth,

400
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:20.450
what,

401
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.700
what did you end up doing?

402
00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:21.919
What,

403
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.950
what did you end up doing as your I went for advice to the

404
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.580
signals association I joined,

405
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.369
and they said,

406
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:28.690
well,

407
00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:29.830
you've done the pay office,

408
00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:31.409
go in for accountancy.

409
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.400
And so that's what he did.

410
00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:34.890
That's what I did.

411
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.890
And that was your career,

412
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.179
was it?

413
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.510
Career,

414
00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:38.030
yes.

415
00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:41.250
Various jobs in that line and then I ended up as

416
00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:44.330
uh doing accountancy for a solicitor's office.

417
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.729
I was there 17 years until I left so.

418
00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:47.869
Hm.

419
00:11:48.219 --> 00:11:48.719
Right.

420
00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:49.369
Now then,

421
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.299
let's get back to Dartmoor.

422
00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:50.840
what's,

423
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.719
what's your first memory of Dartmoor?

424
00:11:53.219 --> 00:11:54.039
Must be

425
00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:55.700
36,

426
00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.539
37,

427
00:11:56.619 --> 00:11:57.440
something like that.

428
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.000
Cycling to school,

429
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.840
everybody cycled those days.

430
00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:01.849
And um

431
00:12:02.219 --> 00:12:04.179
I used to stop and look at the trains on the way,

432
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.969
steam trains,

433
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.299
you know,

434
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.729
and

435
00:12:06.099 --> 00:12:09.000
must see the cornner Chevi at dinner time and things like that.

436
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.309
That was the days when the

437
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.530
China clay railway used to run with the horses pulling.

438
00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:17.830
Trucks of china clay down from Leemore.

439
00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:19.950
They had to cross the main Exeter Road.

440
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.909
The man with the red flag stopped the traffic.

441
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:22.770
It was about

442
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.270
a dozen or so trains a day of these horses.

443
00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:27.549
I haven't got a photograph.

444
00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:29.750
We didn't take pictures in those days,

445
00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:30.429
shame,

446
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:31.690
um.

447
00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:32.429
Then

448
00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.479
of course on the bike and then the weekends I'd

449
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.090
be a bit more venturesome,

450
00:12:37.099 --> 00:12:39.280
but people didn't go on Dartmoor in those days.

451
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.539
And then um.

452
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.049
Well,

453
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:43.659
I

454
00:12:44.799 --> 00:12:45.630
It's like people,

455
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.169
I mean,

456
00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:46.809
some,

457
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.940
many people in the village here never even

458
00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:52.159
went out of a village more than 4 or 5 miles all their life.

459
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.900
That was how things were.

460
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.299
You didn't travel,

461
00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:56.429
um.

462
00:12:57.549 --> 00:12:58.989
And then gradually go on.

463
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.909
I used to go up to Lemore and then ventures into Cornwood and places like that.

464
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.270
Got a little bit interested.

465
00:13:04.309 --> 00:13:05.330
My cousin used to come down.

466
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:06.650
I used to take him out.

467
00:13:07.229 --> 00:13:07.530
So what was it,

468
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.229
what was the appeal?

469
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.770
What was what was drawing you there?

470
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.219
I think

471
00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.880
one of my first books I saw

472
00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:16.929
was a guide book to Dartmoor.

473
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.820
I've still got a couple somewhere.

474
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.119
Showing pictures of

475
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.760
hut circles and stone rows and I think that

476
00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:24.820
was the attraction.

477
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.719
I'd try to find things

478
00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:28.260
from the maps they put in,

479
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.500
but of course they were useless,

480
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.200
they were mainly road maps.

481
00:13:31.849 --> 00:13:34.400
They all remember it was about a six minute publication or something.

482
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.280
And of course I never found anything,

483
00:13:37.299 --> 00:13:39.520
but I got more and more interested and then of course.

484
00:13:42.359 --> 00:13:42.650
Really,

485
00:13:42.729 --> 00:13:46.849
I suppose once I was deprived of being near the moor with.

486
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.739
With the war,

487
00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:50.380
the Blitz,

488
00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:50.900
and then,

489
00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:51.229
oh,

490
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.580
I used to go out during the Blitz,

491
00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:53.500
I can remember now,

492
00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:54.080
yes.

493
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.679
I used to go out

494
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.380
with my dad.

495
00:13:57.849 --> 00:13:59.450
He had a lightweight motorbike,

496
00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:00.770
a 125,

497
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.760
and when he went abroad to serve in Egypt with the forces,

498
00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:06.789
he was called back again in this war,

499
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:08.130
and um.

500
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.559
He said,

501
00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:09.969
uh,

502
00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:11.700
oh you can have my bike.

503
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.760
So

504
00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:13.969
I used to use that.

505
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.359
I could get a bit further,

506
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:15.880
you see,

507
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.039
so I used to go up Orangutan and South Brent and

508
00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:20.299
further up.

509
00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:24.960
And I remember one winter you couldn't get through to Princeton for 33 months,

510
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.289
3 weeks rather,

511
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.270
and so,

512
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:27.739
um

513
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:28.799
snow.

514
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:30.419
Or cut off

515
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.580
and I always remember I got an old,

516
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.969
I think it was a toilet pull chain.

517
00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:39.340
I made chains to fit on the back of a motorbike so I could bump and I

518
00:14:39.599 --> 00:14:41.840
several times I attempted to get through to Princetown.

519
00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:42.559
I got up there,

520
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.190
there was no,

521
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.080
no traffic.

522
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:45.219
Nothing to get up.

523
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.590
The A38,

524
00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:47.799
or what it is now,

525
00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.219
the main Exeter Road.

526
00:14:49.559 --> 00:14:51.320
I remember being at Smitherley.

527
00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:54.159
And the men were trying to clear the

528
00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:56.280
ice off the road with drills

529
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.979
because it was so solid up

530
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.580
the Exeter road was closed for over a week and I was the only motorbike,

531
00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:02.719
no cars.

532
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.659
Can't imagine it.

533
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.960
I mean they were really

534
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.979
hard winters in those days,

535
00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:09.059
which you don't get now.

536
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:10.780
So

537
00:15:11.419 --> 00:15:12.409
that brought me along then.

538
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.500
So how old would you have been you've been in your late teens,

539
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:15.960
would you?

540
00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:17.059
Um,

541
00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:17.340
well,

542
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.679
in 43 I would be,

543
00:15:19.979 --> 00:15:20.729
I would be 20,

544
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:21.210
wouldn't I?

545
00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:21.659
Yes,

546
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:22.780
43.

547
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.119
I know I had my,

548
00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:25.299
I had my

549
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.520
21st birthday in Holland.

550
00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:28.960
And I had a,

551
00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:31.479
an iced bun with a candle stuck in it

552
00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:34.619
at a place called Swarbro in Holland,

553
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.570
that was my 21st,

554
00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:36.559
I was on duty.

555
00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:38.059
So.

556
00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.030
So,

557
00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:40.210
um,

558
00:15:40.409 --> 00:15:40.570
before,

559
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.570
before the war then you were,

560
00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:42.950
you were gradually gradually more

561
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.849
and he must have had a real adventurous sort of spirit.

562
00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:47.000
What,

563
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.250
what,

564
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.380
what,

565
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.330
what do you think was drawing,

566
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.200
I suppose so.

567
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:49.809
I mean,

568
00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:51.270
in those days,

569
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.369
if it was a.

570
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.479
Children we knew if they had a party at Billiha 1 mile away.

571
00:15:57.429 --> 00:15:58.750
We felt we did nothing,

572
00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:00.830
we felt er thought nothing of walking through

573
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.580
the woods and coming back midnight or something.

574
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.859
Boys and girls,

575
00:16:04.989 --> 00:16:06.380
no trouble in those days.

576
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:07.789
Yeah,

577
00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:08.250
we,

578
00:16:08.469 --> 00:16:10.530
you could walk into town and back and

579
00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:11.750
hardly see anybody,

580
00:16:11.789 --> 00:16:12.489
you know.

581
00:16:13.109 --> 00:16:14.010
It was so

582
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:15.650
free

583
00:16:15.869 --> 00:16:18.270
now looking back to what it is today.

584
00:16:18.669 --> 00:16:19.799
Although I'm still free,

585
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.380
but it's the young people now and especially girls.

586
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:23.969
Well,

587
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.450
quite a few areas uh you wouldn't go,

588
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.109
I wouldn't go to now.

589
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.659
Whereas,

590
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.299
Since the war,

591
00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:33.979
I've been to the Dockland area in Cardiff and

592
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.690
They used to say

593
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.190
up there,

594
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:37.349
oh you mustn't go there,

595
00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:38.239
you mustn't do there,

596
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:40.690
but I went one day in scout uniform and

597
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.070
to meet some of the deprived children there and.

598
00:16:44.619 --> 00:16:46.309
And that's not many years ago now,

599
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:46.590
you know,

600
00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.030
that's only about 30 years ago,

601
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:48.570
which

602
00:16:48.989 --> 00:16:50.349
haven't things changed?

603
00:16:52.429 --> 00:16:54.809
And then of course coming back after the war.

604
00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:57.359
I wanted to join

605
00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.739
an association,

606
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.539
so I joined the Devonshire Association.

607
00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:02.200
Hansford Worth proposed me.

608
00:17:02.859 --> 00:17:03.900
So tell me about Hansfordworth.

609
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:04.839
How did you meet him?

610
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.598
Well,

611
00:17:05.979 --> 00:17:06.579
in my thing,

612
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.699
when I say at the beginning how I first met him,

613
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.130
I,

614
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.500
I was told about him.

615
00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.300
I rung him up.

616
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:12.079
I

617
00:17:12.219 --> 00:17:12.939
invited in,

618
00:17:12.979 --> 00:17:14.459
and that's the night I met at that.

619
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.500
I left at that unearthly hour in the morning.

620
00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:16.939
I mean,

621
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.358
he was so full of Dartmoor.

622
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:19.810
So how,

623
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.660
who was it that told you about him?

624
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:21.819
Well,

625
00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:22.608
I probably,

626
00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:23.180
it was.

627
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.030
Probably it was Mr.

628
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.510
Copeland,

629
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.640
GW Copeland,

630
00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:29.410
who was the secretary of a local Devonshire Association.

631
00:17:30.329 --> 00:17:32.709
Because I joined the Devonshire Association,

632
00:17:33.189 --> 00:17:34.630
got involved with Hansford Worth,

633
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.329
and he

634
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.859
made me a member of the Doubtful Preservation,

635
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:40.050
which by the way,

636
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.979
just a couple of months ago I was

637
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.689
nominated honorary life

638
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.550
vice president of that,

639
00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:48.119
so that was quite an honour.

640
00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:51.810
And um then I joined the Plymouth and District Field Club of which

641
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:53.069
I'm still a member,

642
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.750
I'm an honorary mem honorary life member of that.

643
00:17:57.489 --> 00:17:57.640
So,

644
00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:57.760
sorry,

645
00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:58.890
going back to Handsworth Words,

646
00:17:58.930 --> 00:17:59.089
I mean,

647
00:17:59.170 --> 00:17:59.880
I know you've got it written there,

648
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.250
but I need,

649
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.290
it'd be nice to have the story on tape a little bit.

650
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:02.609
So

651
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:03.989
how did you

652
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:04.640
get to know him?

653
00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:04.869
How,

654
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.209
what was,

655
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:06.209
what was your introduction?

656
00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:06.369
Well,

657
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.109
that was the first thing because he knew,

658
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.410
I was told to contact him.

659
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:11.910
He was in both associations.

660
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.739
Was it through your interest in Darling,

661
00:18:15.329 --> 00:18:15.689
you must,

662
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.170
you must meet Hansford Burth

663
00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:17.689
Worth,

664
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:18.229
you see,

665
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:18.890
um.

666
00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:21.510
So you rang him up and knocked on his door and went.

667
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:21.719
No,

668
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.750
I just rang him up and he told me to come in

669
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.670
and little did I know I wouldn't come back for several hours.

670
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:27.369
Um,

671
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:28.189
excuse me a minute.

672
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.709
So your first visit to him and he was so enthusiastic.

673
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:36.869
I mean to me he looked,

674
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:37.550
as a youngster,

675
00:18:37.589 --> 00:18:39.290
he looked like an old man because he had a beard,

676
00:18:39.349 --> 00:18:39.540
he,

677
00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:42.810
he always wore a little what they call a smoking cap

678
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.479
and er he looked quite an old person then like

679
00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:49.089
and he was so enthusiastic.

680
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:52.130
And then I got doing things,

681
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.989
learning things about Dartmoor.

682
00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.060
He would then give me little jobs to do.

683
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:56.920
Um,

684
00:18:57.089 --> 00:18:59.209
did you visited him regularly,

685
00:18:59.250 --> 00:18:59.650
did you?

686
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.670
I didn't visit him unfortunately many times.

687
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.869
I only think

688
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.859
I can vividly remember the first time,

689
00:19:09.939 --> 00:19:12.650
but whether I went in two or three times afterwards,

690
00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:14.709
unfortunately he died in,

691
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.589
I think it was 54,

692
00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:18.579
so it wasn't all that long I knew him,

693
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.199
but

694
00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:20.199
I had

695
00:19:20.619 --> 00:19:23.420
piles of cards upstairs and letters from him.

696
00:19:23.949 --> 00:19:24.540
Um,

697
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.780
I've only unfortunately got one which I've photographed,

698
00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:28.369
which

699
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.540
was signed by Hansford Worth.

700
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.459
All the rest used to be a postcard with RHW.

701
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.349
Can you do so and so,

702
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.910
pleased to hear about so and so,

703
00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:37.140
very,

704
00:19:37.189 --> 00:19:38.089
very short.

705
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.810
And um

706
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.319
because he was still very busy at the time on his um.

707
00:19:44.739 --> 00:19:46.060
Civil engineering work,

708
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.780
plans,

709
00:19:46.859 --> 00:19:47.500
making plans,

710
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.660
he did a plan for a certain water filtration plant,

711
00:19:50.939 --> 00:19:52.439
he did plans for the

712
00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:53.859
intake on the urn,

713
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.719
which was a new

714
00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:57.459
intake bringing water to Plympton.

715
00:19:58.599 --> 00:19:59.180
And

716
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.680
I remember once he rang me up,

717
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.260
he said,

718
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:03.239
I'm very worried,

719
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.560
he said,

720
00:20:03.599 --> 00:20:05.140
I've just heard a report

721
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.180
that

722
00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:07.719
the military have put

723
00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:09.390
A circle,

724
00:20:09.949 --> 00:20:12.010
a circle of markers

725
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.199
right on top of our wonderful stone row up Yam Valley,

726
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.630
that's the longest stone row

727
00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:17.849
which we have on Dartmoor,

728
00:20:17.969 --> 00:20:19.569
it's 2.25 miles long.

729
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.079
Dating back 4000 years to the Bronze Age,

730
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.329
and um,

731
00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:25.069
he said,

732
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.109
can you go up and look at it,

733
00:20:26.189 --> 00:20:27.750
so I rushed up the next morning,

734
00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.770
Sunday,

735
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.979
and I went up and luckily,

736
00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:35.589
Nearby I found a group of the Dartmoor Rambling Clun,

737
00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:36.939
so they helped me,

738
00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:38.439
and we all sabotaged it,

739
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.439
or in,

740
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.339
in worse

741
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:41.540
words,

742
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.599
dismantled it and put all the stones back that had been stolen,

743
00:20:44.719 --> 00:20:46.140
put them back in out of sight,

744
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.420
and it turned out

745
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.839
he acted immediately.

746
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.199
I got home that night because that was due to be bombed the next morning.

747
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.260
They were setting up a bomb,

748
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.760
bombing target on

749
00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:57.979
on

750
00:20:58.219 --> 00:20:59.079
Roughborough Down.

751
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.760
To me to them,

752
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.849
the Erne Valley was Roughborough Down,

753
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.020
nowhere near Oborough.

754
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.459
So that was just one of the little scares.

755
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.589
There's been several scares like that we've had.

756
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.900
Another thing I was very concerned that got my interest up was,

757
00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:17.300
he was dead against all the damage being done with the military.

758
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.680
They'd done an awful lot during the war in training and they still were,

759
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.099
um,

760
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:22.729
they were.

761
00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:23.790
You know,

762
00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:26.689
firing at stone circles and things like that,

763
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:27.949
and uh.

764
00:21:28.989 --> 00:21:31.050
I went out and with other help

765
00:21:31.469 --> 00:21:32.209
I'd find.

766
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:33.680
Uh,

767
00:21:33.979 --> 00:21:37.000
trip wires set with set with flares and

768
00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:38.239
all these.

769
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.500
Uh,

770
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.739
big bangers and things all attached to.

771
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.270
Kind of booby traps.

772
00:21:45.089 --> 00:21:46.949
I remember one case I

773
00:21:47.369 --> 00:21:48.849
was walking up the Erme Valley.

774
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:49.949
I've still got a

775
00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:51.949
some letter about that,

776
00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:55.209
and I found a telemine let into the trackway.

777
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.969
A telemine was kind I was familiar with.

778
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.449
It was

779
00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.790
something like the size

780
00:22:00.209 --> 00:22:01.349
size of a dinner plate

781
00:22:01.729 --> 00:22:04.010
with a plunger and it would be buried slightly in the ground.

782
00:22:04.209 --> 00:22:05.229
Anybody tread on it.

783
00:22:06.449 --> 00:22:08.910
So I came back and I phoned the police and they

784
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.329
said,

785
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:10.410
come up with us tomorrow.

786
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.349
So the police took me out to the moors the next morning.

787
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.530
We got up to it.

788
00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:15.609
It was already gone off,

789
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.989
killed,

790
00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.069
killed a bullock.

791
00:22:17.699 --> 00:22:18.250
Things like that.

792
00:22:18.319 --> 00:22:19.150
And this was

793
00:22:19.449 --> 00:22:21.719
the kind of the atmosphere it was at the end of the war.

794
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.469
We didn't know what was lying about.

795
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:24.969
The,

796
00:22:25.489 --> 00:22:26.119
to me,

797
00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:26.829
I mean,

798
00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.800
we always had our ammunition counted and everybody had to have it checked,

799
00:22:30.989 --> 00:22:32.449
make sure we hadn't lost any

800
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.849
or used any,

801
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:34.750
and yet

802
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.969
they were so careless on them or they were leaving mortar bombs around.

803
00:22:39.859 --> 00:22:41.920
Unknown numbers of things they were leaving.

804
00:22:42.459 --> 00:22:44.920
Of course you probably read some of it over the years as

805
00:22:45.219 --> 00:22:46.599
been as little bits of trouble

806
00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:47.640
still going on.

807
00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:48.000
I mean,

808
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.939
2 years ago I found about 50 rounds out there.

809
00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:51.829
Really?

810
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:53.239
Yeah.

811
00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.140
So all this work you were doing as as a member of the Preservation Society,

812
00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:57.380
yeah.

813
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:57.969
Yes,

814
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.430
which was more or less him and about 5 of us

815
00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:03.040
because the association was

816
00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.849
He was so small in those days.

817
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.810
He was secretary,

818
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:07.489
chairman,

819
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.270
treasurer and a committee and the lot.

820
00:23:09.329 --> 00:23:09.339
Right.

821
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:10.449
So he,

822
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:10.680
he,

823
00:23:10.729 --> 00:23:10.890
and,

824
00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:11.020
but,

825
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:11.819
and so he was,

826
00:23:11.829 --> 00:23:12.349
um,

827
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.160
how,

828
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:13.969
how did it work then?

829
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:14.180
He,

830
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.660
he sort of tend to contact you and he would just contact me either card or something.

831
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:19.589
And then I started

832
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.050
because he was recorder of Barrows,

833
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.750
I said,

834
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:23.579
once I said,

835
00:23:23.729 --> 00:23:23.890
oh,

836
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.050
I've discovered a,

837
00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:27.089
a kiss vein up at um.

838
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.119
Can you switch off a minute?

839
00:23:29.209 --> 00:23:30.630
I'll I'll just have a that's fine.

840
00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:31.329
I'll pause.

841
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.199
was alive was.

842
00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:35.880
Looking at

843
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.739
Kist veins,

844
00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:39.599
these are the kist vein burials

845
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.869
which I'm very interested about,

846
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.699
and I remember this one.

847
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.459
I did 2 which were published in the,

848
00:23:47.819 --> 00:23:48.520
is it alright?

849
00:23:48.979 --> 00:23:50.359
I did a couple which were.

850
00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:52.609
Published in the

851
00:23:52.829 --> 00:23:56.790
Devonshire Association because he used to do from about 1980 or something,

852
00:23:56.869 --> 00:23:59.010
he used to do every year report on the

853
00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.489
kiss veins and burials that the stone rows that had been discovered.

854
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.910
And then um

855
00:24:04.189 --> 00:24:05.250
when he died,

856
00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.770
I took over his job of

857
00:24:08.089 --> 00:24:10.900
being recorder of barrows for the Devon Association

858
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.250
and this was one of the first ones I did.

859
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.910
This is the one at Red Lake.

860
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.829
I discovered this on walking at night by myself actually.

861
00:24:20.099 --> 00:24:21.569
Now tell me about the discovery of it.

862
00:24:22.109 --> 00:24:22.489
Um,

863
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.290
I was just walking up.

864
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.650
Towards Red Lake,

865
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.930
it was a place I used to go in the daytime,

866
00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.869
um,

867
00:24:30.209 --> 00:24:31.170
to swim sometimes.

868
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.160
I'm we were mad,

869
00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:32.369
you know,

870
00:24:32.449 --> 00:24:35.229
we walked 4 miles on the water to have a swim and come back.

871
00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:36.010
Uh,

872
00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:41.150
and one night I was up here and I spotted what seemed to be a stone circle,

873
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.750
and I got permission to excavate,

874
00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.849
and this is the picture before excavation,

875
00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:47.569
that's the,

876
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:50.140
There's a plan of it and the cover,

877
00:24:50.349 --> 00:24:52.439
which at that time was lying just on the edge,

878
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.010
we moved it to get in,

879
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.339
and this is a discovery inside.

880
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.310
So can you just describe that for us on the tape?

881
00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:58.660
Yes,

882
00:24:58.839 --> 00:24:59.689
it was that you discovered?

883
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.000
They,

884
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:00.750
they kissed vain,

885
00:25:00.839 --> 00:25:01.680
we found a stone,

886
00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:04.660
or I found a stone circle at night when I started.

887
00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:06.479
First of all,

888
00:25:06.699 --> 00:25:07.459
I um.

889
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.300
Went back in daylight to check thoroughly and I found out that there was

890
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640
um a cover there,

891
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.699
lines partly covered in grass,

892
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.069
and underneath you could feel it were stones that could be a kis vein burial,

893
00:25:20.119 --> 00:25:20.579
which

894
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:25.680
chist vein burials hopefully are often still in the original stone circle.

895
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.000
Explain to me what chist vein,

896
00:25:28.189 --> 00:25:29.280
a chist vein is,

897
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.670
it's,

898
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.260
it's a Celtic word and I'm still,

899
00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:34.390
The supporter of worse spelling,

900
00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:36.569
spelling it with a K instead of a C,

901
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.819
because kist vein,

902
00:25:37.829 --> 00:25:39.689
and kist is still used in Scottish

903
00:25:40.069 --> 00:25:40.810
books today,

904
00:25:41.109 --> 00:25:41.500
it's a,

905
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.030
it's a Celtic word meaning,

906
00:25:43.209 --> 00:25:44.209
meaning a box.

907
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.030
So you can have a chist in a Scottish house,

908
00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:50.310
which is a box for clothes or linen or something like that.

909
00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:50.750
Uh,

910
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.469
a chist vein,

911
00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.150
a vein is Celtic for stone,

912
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.819
so it's a,

913
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:56.030
it's a box of stone or a coffin.

914
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.459
So it's a stone coffin,

915
00:25:57.709 --> 00:25:58.170
and

916
00:25:58.589 --> 00:26:00.030
then there would be a cover on top.

917
00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:03.439
Sometimes we find inside we find.

918
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.530
Uh,

919
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.239
something,

920
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.260
sometimes in the past they've discovered pieces of

921
00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.780
an urn where the cremated remains

922
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.660
were placed,

923
00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:12.380
um.

924
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.310
So far,

925
00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:16.959
there's no proof that it was anything else but cremation,

926
00:26:17.219 --> 00:26:19.160
which is rather peculiar because

927
00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:21.619
Cornwall has no trace of cremations,

928
00:26:21.699 --> 00:26:22.459
neither has,

929
00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:23.280
uh,

930
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.449
the Dorset and Wiltshire end in this type of burial,

931
00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:28.199
but in West Wales,

932
00:26:28.579 --> 00:26:30.709
there's also a similar type

933
00:26:30.979 --> 00:26:33.640
of burial with a cremation again.

934
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.780
Now another funny thing is that,

935
00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:38.859
This part of the country used to be called West Wales.

936
00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.920
West Wales now,

937
00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:42.140
up in Wales,

938
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.119
so.

939
00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:46.140
Why was this place called West Wales?

940
00:26:46.219 --> 00:26:48.459
Is it the fact that the same group of people

941
00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:52.030
lived in both because their burials are so similar?

942
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:52.739
I don't know.

943
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.859
At what point was this called West Wales?

944
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:56.800
Oh,

945
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.000
no,

946
00:26:57.109 --> 00:26:57.839
that I don't know.

947
00:26:58.359 --> 00:27:00.479
All I know is it used to be called West Wales.

948
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:02.329
Now this probably comes in

949
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.189
Maybe Roman times,

950
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:04.670
I don't know.

951
00:27:06.209 --> 00:27:06.630
There's so much,

952
00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:06.910
you see,

953
00:27:06.979 --> 00:27:08.290
the trouble with Dartmoor,

954
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.089
there's so little

955
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.329
recorded.

956
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.979
Um,

957
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.849
in the Bronze Age days they couldn't write,

958
00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:15.510
as far as we know they couldn't.

959
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:15.900
Uh,

960
00:27:15.959 --> 00:27:17.729
these were the two objects I found

961
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:18.930
inside,

962
00:27:19.229 --> 00:27:19.719
which was,

963
00:27:20.469 --> 00:27:20.689
uh,

964
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.790
the first objects that have been discovered in a

965
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.180
kissed vein for something like 20 odd years,

966
00:27:25.189 --> 00:27:25.569
which,

967
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.609
That in itself is not surprising because very little work was going on,

968
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:31.180
uh,

969
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.880
that is a um,

970
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.239
A duckbill scraper or a knife

971
00:27:36.939 --> 00:27:38.099
because it's pointed somewhat,

972
00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:40.459
and this is an ordinary flat scraper.

973
00:27:40.739 --> 00:27:44.260
If you can imagine holding this between your thumb and finger,

974
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.760
the edge has been chipped slightly to make it sharper.

975
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.099
You'd have a carcass of an animal laid out in the rain too.

976
00:27:51.614 --> 00:27:52.145
Rot

977
00:27:52.364 --> 00:27:53.755
and once it had got all

978
00:27:54.295 --> 00:27:55.574
kind of gooey and rotten,

979
00:27:55.854 --> 00:27:59.505
you could come along and you could scrape the remaining flesh off and you had,

980
00:28:00.015 --> 00:28:01.765
you had a hide you could use for clothes,

981
00:28:01.814 --> 00:28:02.635
shoes or

982
00:28:03.135 --> 00:28:03.775
anything like that.

983
00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:04.775
And so when are we talking?

984
00:28:04.854 --> 00:28:05.545
What are we talking about?

985
00:28:05.645 --> 00:28:05.954
Uh,

986
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:08.755
I usually say about 4000 years ago.

987
00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:13.035
Modern technology is more or less hinted that it could be between

988
00:28:13.165 --> 00:28:14.734
1700 BC

989
00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:17.765
and 1900 or 1000 BC.

990
00:28:17.854 --> 00:28:19.334
So it's near enough 4000.

991
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.380
And so when,

992
00:28:20.459 --> 00:28:21.810
when was it you made this discovery?

993
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.900
This was made in,

994
00:28:23.099 --> 00:28:23.180
now,

995
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.040
let's see,

996
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.099
48.

997
00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:25.339
Now,

998
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.719
what do I say here?

999
00:28:27.219 --> 00:28:27.849
Um.

1000
00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:30.670
That's another one there,

1001
00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:32.739
Yarmraie Brook up was before that 10,

1002
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.300
and Peak Hill,

1003
00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.569
that was another of mine I did,

1004
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:35.390
um.

1005
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.719
49 I excavated it,

1006
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.089
yes.

1007
00:28:40.239 --> 00:28:41.800
I found it I think in 48,

1008
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.939
excavated in 49.

1009
00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:44.880
Um

1010
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.800
but this was 53,

1011
00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:48.060
it took a bit to get there.

1012
00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:48.819
Um

1013
00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:51.900
and er how many discoveries of your own did you make?

1014
00:28:52.469 --> 00:28:52.829
Oh.

1015
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:54.599
Um,

1016
00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.000
Peak Hill.

1017
00:28:58.339 --> 00:28:58.699
Uh,

1018
00:28:58.709 --> 00:28:59.630
Reddy brook,

1019
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.709
Red Lake.

1020
00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:02.199
Uh,

1021
00:29:02.239 --> 00:29:03.180
there's one on

1022
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.319
below Little Travels Wy store,

1023
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:05.900
uh,

1024
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.500
Little Travelsbury tour I've done.

1025
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.619
There was a partially.

1026
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.699
When I partially did.

1027
00:29:14.609 --> 00:29:16.520
Which is a queer thing up on

1028
00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:18.660
Stinger's Hill up Yam Valley.

1029
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.239
There was one on the late Mister Hurrell's land

1030
00:29:21.819 --> 00:29:23.699
on the Glazebrook above Rangerton.

1031
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:25.949
I think that's about all.

1032
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:27.609
What's it like?

1033
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:27.790
Tell,

1034
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.050
tell me about when you first come across something

1035
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.650
that you think is it a new discovery.

1036
00:29:31.849 --> 00:29:32.010
Yes,

1037
00:29:32.089 --> 00:29:32.810
this was peculiar,

1038
00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:34.349
as you can see in that picture,

1039
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.609
a couple of people came over to us.

1040
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.290
We only saw 4 people in 8 days,

1041
00:29:38.369 --> 00:29:40.150
but 2 people came up to us and said,

1042
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.839
What were you doing?

1043
00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:43.239
You seemed to be bailing out.

1044
00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:43.640
I said,

1045
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:43.839
yes,

1046
00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.989
we have a canvas bucket.

1047
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.500
Although it's high up on the hillside,

1048
00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:47.780
it was full of water.

1049
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.170
So we had to bail it out,

1050
00:29:49.319 --> 00:29:50.020
and I was

1051
00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.280
using a trowel,

1052
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.439
getting the wet,

1053
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.739
damp soil out,

1054
00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:55.760
and all of a sudden I heard a ***.

1055
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.430
You know what a flower pot sounds like,

1056
00:29:57.479 --> 00:29:58.109
that ***,

1057
00:29:58.319 --> 00:29:59.739
that's what flint sounds like.

1058
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.199
There's no flint in Devon or this part,

1059
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.540
and er it must have been traded

1060
00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.719
by the old tribes to be there,

1061
00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:08.239
and somehow it was in the kist vein.

1062
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.030
Usually nothing's found,

1063
00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:11.689
so.

1064
00:30:12.489 --> 00:30:14.510
I presume that flints were too

1065
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:16.290
valuable possession

1066
00:30:16.609 --> 00:30:17.469
that they didn't,

1067
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:19.510
they didn't bury it with the dead or anything,

1068
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:19.930
but.

1069
00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:21.890
So how did that feel to find something then?

1070
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.250
Well,

1071
00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:24.089
I'm,

1072
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:25.530
people often say,

1073
00:30:25.609 --> 00:30:29.030
say I'm very quiet and I don't show a great deal of emotion er

1074
00:30:29.449 --> 00:30:29.849
um.

1075
00:30:31.719 --> 00:30:32.859
I was pleased but

1076
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.430
I'm not one that kind of bubbles over and everything,

1077
00:30:35.439 --> 00:30:37.520
it was very nice to know that.

1078
00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:38.380
um.

1079
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.400
Where did you learn your sort of like archaeological skills?

1080
00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:43.790
Mainly,

1081
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.550
mainly through Hansford Worth and reading.

1082
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:48.959
Um I've got no formal first,

1083
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.430
no formal um

1084
00:30:50.969 --> 00:30:52.609
archaeological training at all,

1085
00:30:52.689 --> 00:30:53.609
but it's just that

1086
00:30:53.969 --> 00:30:55.170
I've built it up over the years.

1087
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.160
You can see I've got masses of books and

1088
00:30:57.569 --> 00:30:57.810
things,

1089
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.489
especially,

1090
00:30:58.609 --> 00:30:59.130
it's these,

1091
00:30:59.170 --> 00:30:59.810
I mean,

1092
00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:00.040
I,

1093
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:02.119
I started taking these from

1094
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.290
Devonshire Association when I joined in 47.

1095
00:31:05.329 --> 00:31:07.479
I bought as many back numbers as I could

1096
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.869
and I used to read through all these

1097
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.150
and er.

1098
00:31:12.359 --> 00:31:15.359
This was the first thing I did when Hansford Worth died.

1099
00:31:16.969 --> 00:31:17.160
Course,

1100
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.750
now,

1101
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.699
another thing when I started.

1102
00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.069
Um

1103
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.689
You might like to read just that little bit.

1104
00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:26.689
Right.

1105
00:31:27.349 --> 00:31:28.520
Perhaps you'd like to read that.

1106
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.040
OK.

1107
00:31:29.459 --> 00:31:30.099
What's this?

1108
00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:31.439
OK.

1109
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.270
When,

1110
00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:33.609
when I er

1111
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.170
first started doing this,

1112
00:31:35.219 --> 00:31:35.930
I went back,

1113
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.540
I went to the library.

1114
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.020
With 6 inch maps,

1115
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.160
which of course were only 1 and 6 each then,

1116
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.000
and they're about 40 odd pounds now,

1117
00:31:44.239 --> 00:31:44.599
uh,

1118
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.000
and I had a virtually a whole set of 6 inch maps on Dartmoor.

1119
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.469
I used to go into a library

1120
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.160
and I started way back in the 1890s,

1121
00:31:52.239 --> 00:31:52.699
all

1122
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.160
Hansford Worth's work on barrows,

1123
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.910
and I'd go through each one listing all that he'd reported,

1124
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.760
and that enabled me to send,

1125
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.579
to set this list out on the next page,

1126
00:32:03.959 --> 00:32:04.280
um,

1127
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.839
There you'll see.

1128
00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:09.420
So this is what that's a list starting

1129
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.839
worth only numbered up to about 12,

1130
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.640
and then all the rest were unnumbered.

1131
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.699
So I went through all his life's work

1132
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.819
each year,

1133
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.300
adding on all the information and preparing this list,

1134
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:20.839
and

1135
00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:22.780
it was just at the time

1136
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.540
that,

1137
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.859
Map references were coming in before that everything was latitude and longitude,

1138
00:32:27.939 --> 00:32:29.079
which was a devil.

1139
00:32:29.459 --> 00:32:29.800
Uh,

1140
00:32:29.819 --> 00:32:32.219
and so you've got the latitude and longitude,

1141
00:32:32.569 --> 00:32:33.040
you've got

1142
00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:34.060
number,

1143
00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.800
the Barrow report is in the name,

1144
00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:36.520
uh,

1145
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:38.290
National Grid reference as well,

1146
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.050
and the ordnance maps it was on

1147
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.119
and various other notes there.

1148
00:32:42.739 --> 00:32:46.030
So I prepared all that and then I for several years I did

1149
00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:47.609
additional work afterwards,

1150
00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:50.319
virtually until the national park came into being,

1151
00:32:50.739 --> 00:32:51.170
um,

1152
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:51.640
then,

1153
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.770
There was more controls and they

1154
00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:55.209
suggested that.

1155
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.459
There shouldn't be so much active excavation as there used to be because I

1156
00:32:59.459 --> 00:33:02.930
was perhaps the last of the old school when we went out with a,

1157
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:03.719
with a,

1158
00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.890
a a trowel and and a a digger and uh

1159
00:33:07.099 --> 00:33:08.500
just worked away and drew,

1160
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:09.800
now they,

1161
00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:15.219
Which is a good thing with all the number of people about that we don't excavate now

1162
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.619
unless you've got a university that can afford the time and the equipment and

1163
00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:20.609
all the rest of it,

1164
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.079
you know.

1165
00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.599
So it's done on a more scientific

1166
00:33:23.819 --> 00:33:24.459
method now,

1167
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.040
which

1168
00:33:25.579 --> 00:33:26.520
didn't used to be.

1169
00:33:27.619 --> 00:33:30.199
So in terms of you remember you said you had to get permission for

1170
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.550
for excavation.

1171
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.939
Where did you get permission from?

1172
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:32.130
Well,

1173
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.719
the local lord of the manor usually and then

1174
00:33:35.439 --> 00:33:37.300
I remember Lord Morley was one.

1175
00:33:37.709 --> 00:33:38.339
Um,

1176
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:38.920
I

1177
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.540
did some work up on

1178
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.530
Harford Moor,

1179
00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.550
and that was

1180
00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:43.099
Mr.

1181
00:33:43.219 --> 00:33:44.510
Howell of Luke'sland.

1182
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:45.140
Uh,

1183
00:33:45.219 --> 00:33:47.640
that again is another story because I was,

1184
00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:49.219
I met them,

1185
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:49.839
the Lukes,

1186
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.790
the Howell family used to,

1187
00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:54.760
they owned 3 or 4 miles of the moor,

1188
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.839
and every summer they used to

1189
00:33:57.609 --> 00:33:58.560
take tables up

1190
00:33:58.729 --> 00:33:59.880
and a Land Rover,

1191
00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.449
and,

1192
00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:00.859
uh,

1193
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.280
they used to picnic or camp for a week

1194
00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:05.739
at Piles Copse on the banks of the Erm.

1195
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.709
And I was walking down.

1196
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.080
I went,

1197
00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.918
I took the train up to Oakhampton,

1198
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.790
and I was walking down two days camping on the way,

1199
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.159
and

1200
00:34:13.478 --> 00:34:16.239
I passed their tables and they were all eaten away,

1201
00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.250
so I got invited to join them.

1202
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.350
It was

1203
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:19.760
Mr.

1204
00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:20.120
and Mrs.

1205
00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.739
Howells and it was a son

1206
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.820
and a daughter

1207
00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.780
and two evacuees that

1208
00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:25.840
returned every year,

1209
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.360
and they invited me to fresh trout tea,

1210
00:34:28.438 --> 00:34:28.958
you see.

1211
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.659
So

1212
00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.120
I'd,

1213
00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:31.560
I've known them ever since.

1214
00:34:31.918 --> 00:34:32.080
Well,

1215
00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.840
now I go back and just recent years I've.

1216
00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.860
Given some of my photographs of a family to the present

1217
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:39.840
Mr.

1218
00:34:39.879 --> 00:34:40.280
Howell,

1219
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.080
which is lord of the manor,

1220
00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:42.949
um,

1221
00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:43.780
he,

1222
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.600
he was actually I think about 15 or 16,

1223
00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.139
it was in a photograph I took

1224
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.958
on the banks of the river all those years ago.

1225
00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.280
So that's,

1226
00:34:52.379 --> 00:34:53.540
that was one place,

1227
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.639
um there's,

1228
00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:56.199
Colonel

1229
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.100
Major Passey of Cornwood,

1230
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.100
he was another one.

1231
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.889
Then there was another one I had to go through solicitors in Plymouth,

1232
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:03.739
um,

1233
00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.409
so you had to get permission from the landowner,

1234
00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:06.370
landowner,

1235
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.540
anybody else interested,

1236
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.919
but usually it was a landowner.

1237
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:09.399
I mean,

1238
00:35:09.699 --> 00:35:10.939
these flints were on Mr.

1239
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:11.659
Howell's land,

1240
00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.080
and a picture in there,

1241
00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:15.179
and he said I could keep them to,

1242
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.580
you know,

1243
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:16.689
his property,

1244
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:19.459
but he said I could keep them to go around and show to people.

1245
00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:20.419
So you still have them,

1246
00:35:20.489 --> 00:35:20.820
do you?

1247
00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:21.139
Yes,

1248
00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:21.500
I've got,

1249
00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:23.090
I'll show you in a minute if you like,

1250
00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:23.780
um.

1251
00:35:24.649 --> 00:35:24.850
Yes,

1252
00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:25.780
it's er,

1253
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:27.699
but it's a whole different now,

1254
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.120
it's all rules and regulation and forms,

1255
00:35:30.129 --> 00:35:30.540
but,

1256
00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:33.129
but I'm still doing research in different things.

1257
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.679
I can show you that later.

1258
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:36.159
Can you,

1259
00:35:36.209 --> 00:35:36.560
uh,

1260
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.129
going back to your work with um

1261
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.040
um with Worth,

1262
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.929
what can you tell me a little bit more about

1263
00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:42.290
perhaps some of the work that you did with him?

1264
00:35:42.399 --> 00:35:42.610
Did you?

1265
00:35:42.719 --> 00:35:42.850
Well,

1266
00:35:42.899 --> 00:35:43.669
I didn't

1267
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.100
see he was in the office all day and I suppose that.

1268
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.879
His younger younger life was when he did most of his work

1269
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.139
and um.

1270
00:35:54.729 --> 00:35:55.649
So in,

1271
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.120
when you think of it afterwards,

1272
00:35:57.129 --> 00:35:59.610
I used to go to meetings when he was talking to the field club

1273
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.010
or talking to the DA and all the rest and then I went on the

1274
00:36:04.149 --> 00:36:05.750
I used to go to the annual meeting

1275
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.649
every year of the Devonshire Association when he was

1276
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:13.169
when he was chairman of a local branch or just a member

1277
00:36:13.399 --> 00:36:14.330
and um

1278
00:36:15.169 --> 00:36:15.610
One year,

1279
00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:16.090
what was it,

1280
00:36:16.169 --> 00:36:17.350
19 something,

1281
00:36:17.649 --> 00:36:18.129
he.

1282
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:20.790
I'll try to find it.

1283
00:36:20.909 --> 00:36:21.250
He,

1284
00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:28.100
Is that right,

1285
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.800
I'll tell you when I'll find it.

1286
00:36:29.919 --> 00:36:30.169
Oh.

1287
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:30.679
That's fine.

1288
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.520
Let's see this.

1289
00:36:32.489 --> 00:36:33.350
What's this?

1290
00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:34.370
Oh wow.

1291
00:36:34.449 --> 00:36:35.050
What's this?

1292
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.550
That's our dad's bike.

1293
00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:37.820
That's the one you were talking about.

1294
00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:38.050
Yes.

1295
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:38.870
And there's

1296
00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:40.290
wartime blackout.

1297
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.449
Look,

1298
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.830
that's all you're allowed for light.

1299
00:36:43.649 --> 00:36:44.530
The headlamp blackout on the head.

1300
00:36:45.729 --> 00:36:48.149
Where was the air raid shelter in the garden in Dad's garden.

1301
00:36:48.689 --> 00:36:49.330
Fantastic.

1302
00:36:50.459 --> 00:36:50.469
Uh,

1303
00:36:50.979 --> 00:36:51.719
great pictures.

1304
00:36:52.149 --> 00:36:54.379
And uh so that bike took you many places.

1305
00:36:54.639 --> 00:36:55.060
Oh yes,

1306
00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:55.340
yes.

1307
00:36:55.419 --> 00:36:55.620
I've been,

1308
00:36:55.699 --> 00:36:56.179
this is where,

1309
00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:56.540
you know,

1310
00:36:56.659 --> 00:36:57.060
Wembry,

1311
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.489
don't you?

1312
00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.699
That's Wembbury where the defence is.

1313
00:36:59.899 --> 00:37:00.120
Right.

1314
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.419
I'm going to see.

1315
00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:02.620
Oh,

1316
00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:03.260
you're going to see.

1317
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:03.729
All right.

1318
00:37:03.939 --> 00:37:04.199
Yeah.

1319
00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:08.610
All this is after the war because we weren't allowed,

1320
00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:09.300
yes,

1321
00:37:09.379 --> 00:37:11.199
we weren't allowed to photograph during the war.

1322
00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:12.500
So

1323
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.419
now I've got one here of Hansford Worth,

1324
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.760
that's what I'm looking for.

1325
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.020
And,

1326
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:19.919
Now,

1327
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.399
here you are.

1328
00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:20.879
Now this,

1329
00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.459
this is when he took the,

1330
00:37:22.879 --> 00:37:23.780
I've already,

1331
00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.199
it took me a week to get the person who owned the copyright.

1332
00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:30.280
That was a group of about 100 of us at the annual

1333
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.139
meeting at Tavistock and this was Hansford Worth and his wife.

1334
00:37:33.899 --> 00:37:33.909
There,

1335
00:37:34.909 --> 00:37:35.500
what a great picture.

1336
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.439
When would that have been?

1337
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.250
Um,

1338
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.340
I can tell you the date.

1339
00:37:44.229 --> 00:37:44.989
What's that say?

1340
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:47.489
Oh,

1341
00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.000
I haven't,

1342
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.939
hasn't got the date,

1343
00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.000
hasn't got the date.

1344
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.629
I'll put the date I took it,

1345
00:37:52.479 --> 00:37:52.489
uh,

1346
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.010
one minute,

1347
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.949
it would be.

1348
00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:55.340
Oh,

1349
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.320
that's stupid.

1350
00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:00.679
Uh,

1351
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.580
this should give it.

1352
00:38:02.909 --> 00:38:03.600
I hope,

1353
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:04.510
uh,

1354
00:38:04.629 --> 00:38:05.199
excuse me.

1355
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:05.830
OK.

1356
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.919
17th of June 14949

1357
00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:10.399
and I've got here

1358
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.639
a picture of

1359
00:38:11.979 --> 00:38:12.840
taken at the

1360
00:38:13.379 --> 00:38:14.780
meeting of a big group,

1361
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.139
but here's the um

1362
00:38:16.459 --> 00:38:18.139
Hansford Worth and his wife.

1363
00:38:18.459 --> 00:38:20.239
I've got his signature on a letter,

1364
00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.360
uh some pictures taken

1365
00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:25.179
on that day out of the Devonshire Association,

1366
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.889
the Stone row at Merrivale,

1367
00:38:27.379 --> 00:38:30.780
walking up to Crock and Tor which I remember at the time,

1368
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.479
he said,

1369
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:32.939
I'm not able to climb up there.

1370
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.850
I'll wait while you climb up.

1371
00:38:35.419 --> 00:38:37.110
There's everybody climbing up.

1372
00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:40.149
I don't know why I took the horse that was somewhere on the way,

1373
00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:41.449
um.

1374
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.260
A picture of,

1375
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.659
uh,

1376
00:38:44.669 --> 00:38:46.229
that would be Hockney Tor.

1377
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.870
We went up the Grimmspone.

1378
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.250
So

1379
00:38:48.689 --> 00:38:51.810
to get there we passed Hockney Tor and that's um

1380
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:53.600
Oh dear,

1381
00:38:53.949 --> 00:38:56.469
that's a farmhouse down below Chaw Gully.

1382
00:38:56.889 --> 00:38:58.229
I just forget the name offhand.

1383
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:59.149
There's Grimspone.

1384
00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.040
That is

1385
00:39:00.229 --> 00:39:03.129
a place that was excavated in the end of the

1386
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.750
19th century,

1387
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:05.570
uh,

1388
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.610
showing the surrounding wall

1389
00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:09.770
and the principal huts.

1390
00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:14.209
And there's Hansford Worth himself inside the main hut.

1391
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.510
At Grimm's Pond

1392
00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:17.969
with actually that's a,

1393
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.649
I think as a Tavistock Gazette reporter they are taking notes

1394
00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:24.110
but there's Hansford Worth typical

1395
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.689
dress with his beard and his hat on.

1396
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.399
Nice and.

1397
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.899
Interesting memories.

1398
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.409
Yes,

1399
00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:33.320
so.

1400
00:39:34.149 --> 00:39:34.919
In terms of the,

1401
00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:35.179
your,

1402
00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:35.899
your work with the,

1403
00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:37.350
with the Dartmouth Preservation Association,

1404
00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:38.520
has that continued on.

1405
00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:39.860
It continued,

1406
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.449
uh,

1407
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.689
very.

1408
00:39:42.939 --> 00:39:43.479
Much

1409
00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.419
isolated,

1410
00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.739
more or less my own self and one or two others who belonged,

1411
00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:49.639
uh,

1412
00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.820
it didn't really pick up into,

1413
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.040
Into more recent years when Sylvia Sayer got interested,

1414
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.699
that's when she had the

1415
00:39:59.919 --> 00:40:01.540
energy and enthusiasm

1416
00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:05.219
to get involved with the Dartmoor Preservation and then we,

1417
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.219
it's grown now to must be getting on for 1000 members or something.

1418
00:40:11.459 --> 00:40:12.610
And you're still heavily involved.

1419
00:40:12.669 --> 00:40:12.830
I,

1420
00:40:12.909 --> 00:40:13.439
I'm,

1421
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:16.050
I won't say I'm heavily involved with them,

1422
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.310
but I do things for them as much as I can,

1423
00:40:19.429 --> 00:40:22.429
but most of course since I joined the National Park years ago,

1424
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:23.669
I do much more for them.

1425
00:40:24.409 --> 00:40:25.610
My days of a national park.

1426
00:40:27.129 --> 00:40:29.510
I was hoping to find a date I started.

1427
00:40:29.689 --> 00:40:30.750
It was with.

1428
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.020
Um,

1429
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.010
what was he called?

1430
00:40:34.209 --> 00:40:35.520
Owen Evans

1431
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.679
was the

1432
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.750
officer,

1433
00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:39.379
and he lived at Totnes.

1434
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.989
And

1435
00:40:42.209 --> 00:40:45.469
I saw in the paper I heard something about

1436
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:46.429
they wanted

1437
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.820
volunteer wardens

1438
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.889
and so I I wrote to him and I joined.

1439
00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:56.590
I must find out the date I started but I think it was about.

1440
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.110
Um,

1441
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.439
Must have been the early 70s somewhere,

1442
00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:07.399
I joined as a volunteer ward.

1443
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.800
While I was in the warden service.

1444
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.790
We had

1445
00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:18.550
an idea to give walks and I always remember I took the wardens out for a walk

1446
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.790
to show them what I did on walks because I'd already been doing it for years,

1447
00:41:23.169 --> 00:41:25.479
uh on my own and through WEA.

1448
00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.350
Shortly after that,

1449
00:41:28.669 --> 00:41:30.489
they had the Countryside commission

1450
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.729
experiment,

1451
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:35.929
whereby the Countryside Commission financed the national park

1452
00:41:36.389 --> 00:41:36.810
to.

1453
00:41:37.689 --> 00:41:39.239
Do about 1000 walks a year.

1454
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.909
I mean this was unheard of in the warden service we did 3 walks,

1455
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.030
um,

1456
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.070
about 10 a year or something like that and then all of a sudden,

1457
00:41:48.219 --> 00:41:50.820
Countryside commissioner said that's a bright idea,

1458
00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:52.520
we'll finance the

1459
00:41:52.629 --> 00:41:54.209
finance the national park,

1460
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.020
to put on a lot of walks over I think it was a 3 year period,

1461
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.379
and so we must have had nearly 3000 walks,

1462
00:42:01.679 --> 00:42:02.199
and we'll,

1463
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.850
Take all the summary of how many people attend and all the rest of it

1464
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.409
and see what we think of it,

1465
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.429
so they got that result and then

1466
00:42:10.689 --> 00:42:11.750
from that day,

1467
00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:15.070
walks have just continued and that is what is the present

1468
00:42:15.209 --> 00:42:15.889
national park.

1469
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.030
Guided walks

1470
00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:19.010
as it is today,

1471
00:42:19.129 --> 00:42:20.870
so I was right at the beginning of that.

1472
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:21.649
And how,

1473
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:22.129
how,

1474
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.610
how have you seen them develop?

1475
00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:24.979
Well,

1476
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.239
they've developed in the very beginning,

1477
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.669
they were walks,

1478
00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:30.760
and everybody was left

1479
00:42:30.919 --> 00:42:32.250
to their own devices,

1480
00:42:32.459 --> 00:42:33.379
what they went to,

1481
00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.379
where they went,

1482
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.389
and all the rest,

1483
00:42:35.629 --> 00:42:36.159
which

1484
00:42:37.219 --> 00:42:37.800
each guide,

1485
00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:40.040
which I'm pleased to say is still the same.

1486
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.879
We are told

1487
00:42:42.629 --> 00:42:43.929
We more or less offer

1488
00:42:44.189 --> 00:42:47.090
particular areas and we're told which areas to go to,

1489
00:42:47.389 --> 00:42:48.510
but it's left to us,

1490
00:42:48.629 --> 00:42:51.620
which I think is nice because if a person turns up

1491
00:42:51.949 --> 00:42:52.629
to go with Mr.

1492
00:42:52.709 --> 00:42:53.310
A

1493
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.389
and then a fortnight later goes to the same area with Mr.

1494
00:42:56.429 --> 00:42:56.770
B,

1495
00:42:56.949 --> 00:42:57.949
they'll get a different story,

1496
00:42:58.070 --> 00:42:58.219
not,

1497
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.350
not contradicting,

1498
00:42:59.709 --> 00:43:02.050
but each guide has his own familiar little

1499
00:43:02.949 --> 00:43:04.149
things he likes to talk about.

1500
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.540
So one might talk about the wildlife and the plants,

1501
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.669
and I might talk about it.

1502
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.100
The archaeology and that,

1503
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:12.739
and

1504
00:43:14.199 --> 00:43:14.790
Now,

1505
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.219
the walks have

1506
00:43:16.909 --> 00:43:18.159
blossomed out from that.

1507
00:43:18.479 --> 00:43:18.820
They're

1508
00:43:18.949 --> 00:43:20.100
more specific.

1509
00:43:20.399 --> 00:43:23.300
Now they say this is a botanical walk or this is a

1510
00:43:23.439 --> 00:43:25.500
a bird watching walk or painting

1511
00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:26.439
walk.

1512
00:43:26.679 --> 00:43:27.850
Everything now is,

1513
00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:28.600
it's,

1514
00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:31.780
it's evolving from the humble beginnings really.

1515
00:43:32.399 --> 00:43:33.699
And are they much more popular?

1516
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.070
Uh,

1517
00:43:35.729 --> 00:43:37.449
they got very popular.

1518
00:43:38.139 --> 00:43:39.040
A few years ago,

1519
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.780
now they seem to be dropping a little,

1520
00:43:42.129 --> 00:43:45.459
possibly because we've saturated the home market

1521
00:43:45.699 --> 00:43:46.340
and we get,

1522
00:43:46.699 --> 00:43:48.300
it's only the visitors more.

1523
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.580
Although there again I've got one person that turns up on many of my walks,

1524
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:52.939
so I say,

1525
00:43:52.979 --> 00:43:53.969
why do you keep on coming,

1526
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.219
he said,

1527
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:54.379
oh,

1528
00:43:54.419 --> 00:43:55.280
I like the company.

1529
00:43:56.159 --> 00:43:56.169
So.

1530
00:43:57.679 --> 00:43:57.840
No,

1531
00:43:57.919 --> 00:44:01.459
I think the numbers have dropped a bit because we've helped people

1532
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.580
to understand them more and to go out on their own.

1533
00:44:05.639 --> 00:44:08.179
But in a way this is what my night walks are doing as well.

1534
00:44:08.429 --> 00:44:09.699
People get the confidence.

1535
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:11.939
So tell me about when you first,

1536
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:12.100
you,

1537
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.040
because you started doing walk guided walks on your own before the national,

1538
00:44:15.209 --> 00:44:15.580
I started.

1539
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.219
How did you get,

1540
00:44:16.379 --> 00:44:17.550
why did you start doing that?

1541
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:18.080
Well,

1542
00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:18.379
I mean,

1543
00:44:18.459 --> 00:44:20.199
I started from taking out.

1544
00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:21.689
As a,

1545
00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:22.939
as a say a teen,

1546
00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:23.260
well,

1547
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.010
they didn't call them teenagers in nowadays,

1548
00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:25.889
we were just youngsters,

1549
00:44:25.939 --> 00:44:27.179
a youngster of a teenage,

1550
00:44:27.419 --> 00:44:27.879
say,

1551
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.020
I started taking out two or three friends and we'd go out.

1552
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.760
I remember

1553
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.360
I belonged to a couple of clubs in the village and

1554
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:35.820
I'd say,

1555
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:36.020
oh,

1556
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.929
let's go on the moors,

1557
00:44:36.939 --> 00:44:37.860
and I'd take them out,

1558
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.050
maybe half a dozen,

1559
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.239
10 of them on the day and we used to go out

1560
00:44:41.419 --> 00:44:42.419
and that was our weekends,

1561
00:44:42.459 --> 00:44:42.939
you see.

1562
00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:44.969
I didn't play football or anything like that,

1563
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:45.399
so.

1564
00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.810
And that's the kind of thing I started with that and then I,

1565
00:44:48.979 --> 00:44:49.959
I remember,

1566
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.820
I think one of the first talks I gave,

1567
00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:54.469
apart from the ones I gave

1568
00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:56.600
to my own club for nothing,

1569
00:44:57.179 --> 00:44:59.300
I went over to Plympton and I got the,

1570
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.459
I think it was 2 and 6 including travelling to talk to somebody over there,

1571
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.120
you know.

1572
00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:05.669
So

1573
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:09.129
that's how it started like that and it got more and

1574
00:45:09.129 --> 00:45:11.750
then all of a sudden just after we were married.

1575
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.540
I had a letter

1576
00:45:13.919 --> 00:45:16.479
passed from my father to from his address and he

1577
00:45:16.959 --> 00:45:20.060
inside it said the WEA would you like to run a series of

1578
00:45:20.449 --> 00:45:21.600
classes on um

1579
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:22.679
on Dartmoor.

1580
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.540
This was

1581
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:25.919
alternate say indoor and outdoor,

1582
00:45:25.959 --> 00:45:26.840
indoor and outdoor,

1583
00:45:26.879 --> 00:45:29.060
and from that involved somebody asking,

1584
00:45:29.719 --> 00:45:31.520
What happens if you get caught in a mist,

1585
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.969
and I said we can't promise a mist,

1586
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.000
let's go out at night.

1587
00:45:34.199 --> 00:45:35.639
So the night walks were born.

1588
00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:37.649
Although I've been doing that before.

1589
00:45:37.879 --> 00:45:38.000
Right,

1590
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:38.919
so when would this have been,

1591
00:45:38.959 --> 00:45:39.540
when did you start,

1592
00:45:39.879 --> 00:45:43.120
what about roughly what date I started WAA it's in that article,

1593
00:45:43.199 --> 00:45:44.699
I think it was about 1954,

1594
00:45:44.739 --> 00:45:46.879
1953,

1595
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.159
probably 1953,

1596
00:45:48.239 --> 00:45:49.300
1954-ish.

1597
00:45:50.199 --> 00:45:50.459
Then

1598
00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:53.199
I used to go out at night on my own

1599
00:45:53.199 --> 00:45:56.139
sometimes and then I used to take my brother-in-law out,

1600
00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.159
um,

1601
00:45:57.639 --> 00:45:59.459
We'd all of a sudden decide let's go to

1602
00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:01.760
the night walks?

1603
00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.040
I don't know.

1604
00:46:04.479 --> 00:46:05.399
Just one of those things,

1605
00:46:05.479 --> 00:46:06.000
you know.

1606
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:06.520
I mean,

1607
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:07.459
I remember

1608
00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.340
I must have been on my own because

1609
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.620
at that time

1610
00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:12.419
there was a lady living at,

1611
00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:15.679
at just below Gutter Tor in what we called the bungalow.

1612
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:17.020
They called it the scout

1613
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:18.419
hut in the recent,

1614
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:19.620
more recent years.

1615
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:21.370
The military's got it now,

1616
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:22.459
but it was

1617
00:46:22.879 --> 00:46:23.040
Mrs.

1618
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.540
Ware used to live at,

1619
00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:25.320
um,

1620
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:26.479
uh.

1621
00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:28.979
Oh dear,

1622
00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:29.979
um.

1623
00:46:35.229 --> 00:46:35.600
I'm sorry,

1624
00:46:35.719 --> 00:46:35.979
can you switch off.

1625
00:46:36.149 --> 00:46:36.510
That's OK.

1626
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:36.629
Yeah,

1627
00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:37.070
that's fine.

1628
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:38.260
I'm just trying to think of the,

1629
00:46:39.439 --> 00:46:39.689
Oh,

1630
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:40.689
I should know it.

1631
00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:41.409
It's got,

1632
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:44.570
it's got 3 stone dog kennels built into the wall,

1633
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:44.969
um,

1634
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.290
not a nun's Cross,

1635
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:46.510
uh,

1636
00:46:46.689 --> 00:46:47.010
permanent.

1637
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.030
Dwy Warren,

1638
00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:48.709
that's it,

1639
00:46:48.919 --> 00:46:49.270
uh.

1640
00:46:50.459 --> 00:46:50.659
Mrs.

1641
00:46:50.899 --> 00:46:51.540
Ware

1642
00:46:52.459 --> 00:46:54.439
In just before the war,

1643
00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:56.689
used to live at Ditsworthy Farm,

1644
00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.040
Ditsworthy Warren House,

1645
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.280
which was down

1646
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.030
on the banks of the Plym,

1647
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.469
the other side of

1648
00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.139
past Gutter Tor and you could walk down to it.

1649
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:05.800
Then

1650
00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.629
her daughter,

1651
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:09.129
I understand it,

1652
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.719
she lived at what we call the bungalow,

1653
00:47:12.979 --> 00:47:15.239
which is later was called the scout.

1654
00:47:16.189 --> 00:47:19.370
Hut because the scouts took it over after she moved away,

1655
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.449
but the bungalow was her house

1656
00:47:21.629 --> 00:47:23.790
and she was a rabbit warrener,

1657
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.110
a farmer.

1658
00:47:26.159 --> 00:47:29.040
Had Warren had rabbits on her land and used to

1659
00:47:29.739 --> 00:47:30.590
farm them

1660
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.620
and uh

1661
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.000
I used to call in

1662
00:47:33.379 --> 00:47:33.780
about.

1663
00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:37.120
10 o'clock at night on New Year's Eve and say hello Mrs.

1664
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:37.600
Ware,

1665
00:47:37.719 --> 00:47:38.679
happy New Year.

1666
00:47:39.199 --> 00:47:40.399
Sometimes she'd offer me a drink,

1667
00:47:40.439 --> 00:47:41.159
other times I'd say,

1668
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:41.360
well,

1669
00:47:41.399 --> 00:47:42.570
I haven't got much time left.

1670
00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.909
I'm going up to Duck'spool in the middle of the moor,

1671
00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:46.479
where's a visitor's book,

1672
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.199
uh,

1673
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.679
to the memory of William Crossing,

1674
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.110
the first Dartmoor guide.

1675
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.399
I'm going up there tonight.

1676
00:47:51.479 --> 00:47:52.260
I'm going to be

1677
00:47:52.439 --> 00:47:53.639
there on midnight.

1678
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.219
Then

1679
00:47:54.439 --> 00:47:55.840
another time I take friends up.

1680
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.580
My wife's been up there in daylight.

1681
00:47:58.129 --> 00:47:58.540
Um,

1682
00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.070
it's a

1683
00:47:59.320 --> 00:47:59.919
very middle,

1684
00:48:00.239 --> 00:48:02.179
almost the very middle of South Dartmoor,

1685
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:03.260
and there's this,

1686
00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:06.800
Rock with a plaque on it and there's a visitor's box in

1687
00:48:07.179 --> 00:48:09.389
a box with a visitor's book in,

1688
00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:12.000
in a hole in the ground and uh used to

1689
00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:14.570
be there to be at midnight on the New Year's.

1690
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.540
So you quite often,

1691
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.780
do you still quite often go up there on your own up to well,

1692
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:20.770
I,

1693
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.280
I have done several times on shorter walks,

1694
00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.520
I advise everybody not to do it,

1695
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.290
but uh,

1696
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:28.649
I mean when I was excavating that time,

1697
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.320
I

1698
00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:30.500
said,

1699
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.149
can you let me have the plans tomorrow?

1700
00:48:32.229 --> 00:48:32.510
I said,

1701
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:32.790
yes.

1702
00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:33.350
Oh dear,

1703
00:48:33.429 --> 00:48:33.850
I said,

1704
00:48:34.149 --> 00:48:34.870
one of my figures,

1705
00:48:34.979 --> 00:48:36.870
one of my cross measurements don't add up.

1706
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.560
I'm going out to dig it up again and quickly check the measurements.

1707
00:48:39.639 --> 00:48:40.550
So I went up one night,

1708
00:48:40.669 --> 00:48:41.060
checked it,

1709
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.830
and got back so I could give him the plans the next day.

1710
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:44.780
Oh,

1711
00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:45.429
it was,

1712
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.300
so,

1713
00:48:46.629 --> 00:48:47.449
what is it about Donald?

1714
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:50.050
What is it that appeal is the appeal?

1715
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:53.939
What's the attraction?

1716
00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.389
Yeah

1717
00:48:58.179 --> 00:48:59.040
You're on your own,

1718
00:48:59.679 --> 00:49:00.540
virtually.

1719
00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.530
You have to deal with everything on your own.

1720
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.889
You have to interpret it.

1721
00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:05.389
It's,

1722
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.449
it's a freedom to enjoy,

1723
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:07.929
I think,

1724
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.270
to enjoy and discover.

1725
00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.750
Quite often I discover new things.

1726
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:13.060
I mean,

1727
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:15.379
I found one or two new things last year.

1728
00:49:15.669 --> 00:49:17.379
You never know what you're going to see,

1729
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.139
and

1730
00:49:19.229 --> 00:49:20.590
When I go out with a party,

1731
00:49:20.679 --> 00:49:21.649
I make,

1732
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.860
I always make

1733
00:49:23.239 --> 00:49:23.800
a root.

1734
00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:25.489
Uh,

1735
00:49:25.909 --> 00:49:27.570
of course we have to now regulations again,

1736
00:49:27.649 --> 00:49:29.209
we have to leave the route where we are.

1737
00:49:29.659 --> 00:49:29.929
Uh,

1738
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.570
it's all very well taking a mobile,

1739
00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:32.729
but most of the time.

1740
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.429
The other day

1741
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:35.729
my mobile said my wife was ringing me.

1742
00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.040
I thought,

1743
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:36.689
whatever's up.

1744
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.850
So I said to the party,

1745
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.149
hang on a minute while I go up that tour so I can get within range,

1746
00:49:41.929 --> 00:49:42.370
um.

1747
00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:44.649
You're

1748
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.020
with a party,

1749
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:46.379
you are,

1750
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.080
you,

1751
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.530
I make this plan,

1752
00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.000
I say so many miles,

1753
00:49:50.419 --> 00:49:52.540
I will be at certain places at a certain time.

1754
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:54.600
I like that because then if a person says,

1755
00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:55.209
look,

1756
00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.139
I've got to be back to catch a bus or something,

1757
00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:57.939
you know what to do.

1758
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.840
You don't know the speed of your party until you've started.

1759
00:50:01.419 --> 00:50:03.340
I always do that and then um.

1760
00:50:04.659 --> 00:50:06.250
Sometimes I think oh no we won't do that,

1761
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.159
we'll go somewhere else or something

1762
00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:09.110
it's,

1763
00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:10.370
it's a freedom,

1764
00:50:10.419 --> 00:50:11.879
you're not bound by

1765
00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.179
walking along a track,

1766
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:13.610
you know,

1767
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.399
you can branch off.

1768
00:50:15.699 --> 00:50:18.020
And what's the pleasure of taking other people up onto the lawns?

1769
00:50:18.419 --> 00:50:18.810
Just that

1770
00:50:19.379 --> 00:50:20.800
I like to show people.

1771
00:50:21.699 --> 00:50:23.639
What I am interested in

1772
00:50:24.139 --> 00:50:25.330
things which perhaps they,

1773
00:50:25.379 --> 00:50:27.100
they'd never see,

1774
00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:27.929
um,

1775
00:50:27.939 --> 00:50:28.800
you're going along,

1776
00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:29.979
you can see,

1777
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.899
you know where there's a small stone covered with grass that's got a number on it,

1778
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.129
you can tell them oh that's,

1779
00:50:35.419 --> 00:50:38.159
that's a measurement from the firing butts from

1780
00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:39.139
this is where they used to.

1781
00:50:39.344 --> 00:50:41.125
Lay down and fire on the

1782
00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:43.094
rifle range in the end of the,

1783
00:50:43.465 --> 00:50:44.735
I used to say the last century,

1784
00:50:44.784 --> 00:50:46.665
but the trouble is now we're into another century.

1785
00:50:46.705 --> 00:50:46.854
I,

1786
00:50:47.064 --> 00:50:50.864
I've got to change everything now into the end of the 19th century though.

1787
00:50:51.195 --> 00:50:51.225
Oh,

1788
00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:53.475
it's terribly confusing that new century

1789
00:50:53.915 --> 00:50:54.695
and uh.

1790
00:50:55.399 --> 00:50:55.600
Yes,

1791
00:50:55.679 --> 00:50:55.800
I,

1792
00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.939
I just like showing people things,

1793
00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:58.600
um,

1794
00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.159
you know,

1795
00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:01.260
and then a person would go along and

1796
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.070
I'd say look at this little bridge,

1797
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.620
a little,

1798
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:05.600
little clam or clapper bridge,

1799
00:51:05.899 --> 00:51:06.199
and they said,

1800
00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.429
but what's it crossing?

1801
00:51:07.479 --> 00:51:07.760
I said,

1802
00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.199
look,

1803
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.120
down there,

1804
00:51:09.239 --> 00:51:09.760
that's a leap,

1805
00:51:09.879 --> 00:51:11.320
oh we didn't see that,

1806
00:51:11.639 --> 00:51:12.260
um.

1807
00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.500
The pipeline that comes down from Red Lake to,

1808
00:51:15.949 --> 00:51:16.229
you know,

1809
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:18.350
the big factory Red Lake trading estate,

1810
00:51:18.429 --> 00:51:20.870
do you know at Cantrill between Ivy Bridge and Bitterford.

1811
00:51:21.229 --> 00:51:23.330
Now that was the tractor factory

1812
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.429
after the war.

1813
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.149
Now originally that was the

1814
00:51:26.409 --> 00:51:28.139
china clay drying sheds.

1815
00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.100
China clay came in 6 inch pipes from Red Lake,

1816
00:51:31.149 --> 00:51:32.530
all those miles down

1817
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:35.090
every few 100 yards there was a manhole cover

1818
00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:36.709
for inspection purposes.

1819
00:51:37.429 --> 00:51:38.250
He knows

1820
00:51:39.669 --> 00:51:41.560
A lot of people would just pass that

1821
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.199
and not realise what was there.

1822
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.199
I like to show people,

1823
00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:44.860
therefore,

1824
00:51:45.919 --> 00:51:46.919
my 3 hour walk,

1825
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.709
where some people would do say 67 miles,

1826
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.500
my 3 hour walk is

1827
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.459
probably 4.5 to 5 because there's so many things.

1828
00:51:55.149 --> 00:51:55.439
Stop.

1829
00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.500
Yes,

1830
00:51:57.199 --> 00:51:58.290
there is so much.

1831
00:51:58.479 --> 00:52:00.020
Is there any part of Dartmoor you don't know.

1832
00:52:01.949 --> 00:52:02.899
I once

1833
00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.520
got a map of Dartmoor and I put lines every walk I'd done.

1834
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.169
There's vast areas I haven't been to.

1835
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:10.949
See,

1836
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.489
there's another one I was only telling somebody the other day,

1837
00:52:13.649 --> 00:52:14.530
look at that photograph,

1838
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.790
there's two stones sticking up like that.

1839
00:52:17.449 --> 00:52:17.969
What is it?

1840
00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:19.449
Not a clue,

1841
00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:19.770
I said.

1842
00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:19.969
Now,

1843
00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:20.270
look,

1844
00:52:20.449 --> 00:52:21.540
there were two stones,

1845
00:52:21.969 --> 00:52:23.899
but a sluice gate for a reservoir.

1846
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.879
If you look carefully in the heather,

1847
00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.229
there's two marks with a slight bank

1848
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.649
on a hillside.

1849
00:52:29.729 --> 00:52:31.750
It was a reservoir to collect rainfall.

1850
00:52:32.209 --> 00:52:33.129
They had a sluice gate.

1851
00:52:33.909 --> 00:52:35.229
And then a lake went down,

1852
00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:37.250
perhaps 3/4 of a mile down the valley

1853
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:38.590
to a water wheel.

1854
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.830
So the men when they wanted to do some crushing of a stone for

1855
00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.389
the tin at tin or.

1856
00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:46.370
They used to have to come up,

1857
00:52:46.729 --> 00:52:47.709
check there was enough water,

1858
00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:48.270
open it up,

1859
00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.669
it'd probably only last 10 minutes,

1860
00:52:50.149 --> 00:52:52.030
give that wheel 10 minutes of work time,

1861
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:54.090
then they'd have to shut the sluice and wait again.

1862
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.149
Little things on the surface that.

1863
00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.300
Where that pipeline is.

1864
00:53:01.489 --> 00:53:03.209
I can be going along and

1865
00:53:03.469 --> 00:53:04.719
I can just pick a,

1866
00:53:05.050 --> 00:53:05.939
either by

1867
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.610
the size of a bracken or or where there's a gap in the bracken,

1868
00:53:09.689 --> 00:53:10.750
where the pipeline is.

1869
00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:14.479
So many little fascinating things like that.

1870
00:53:15.709 --> 00:53:16.100
What's,

1871
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.850
what's your,

1872
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:17.489
can,

1873
00:53:18.189 --> 00:53:22.120
have you got a favourite sort of memory or a favourite story about your time on?

1874
00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:22.330
Ah,

1875
00:53:22.429 --> 00:53:23.550
I could give you another,

1876
00:53:23.889 --> 00:53:26.310
an up to-date one that happened to me 3 years ago.

1877
00:53:26.439 --> 00:53:28.570
Have you heard the story of the hairy hands.

1878
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:30.370
Now lately

1879
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:34.070
they've been confusing it by calling it Hairy Hands Forest.

1880
00:53:34.149 --> 00:53:37.649
It's nothing to do with the forest because that existed before the trees were there.

1881
00:53:38.149 --> 00:53:39.689
Hairy hands is

1882
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:40.399
a legend,

1883
00:53:40.469 --> 00:53:41.669
which I've never bothered about.

1884
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.570
I've had no,

1885
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:44.790
I don't tell stories and I don't.

1886
00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:45.649
I

1887
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.310
know much about legends,

1888
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.840
except I know the hairy hands were supposed to have

1889
00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.199
gripped the hands of travellers who were carried going along in the

1890
00:53:53.199 --> 00:53:56.000
horse carts or was there a particular stretch of the road?

1891
00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.620
Yes,

1892
00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:56.810
uh,

1893
00:53:57.199 --> 00:54:00.709
I always knew it was above the Cherry Brook Bridge between,

1894
00:54:01.879 --> 00:54:02.489
um,

1895
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.600
between Dart meat,

1896
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.179
sorry,

1897
00:54:04.669 --> 00:54:06.280
between two bridges and postsbridge.

1898
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040
Now,

1899
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:09.330
I never took much notice about it,

1900
00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.520
and they said there's been.

1901
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.810
Somebody was supposed to have died from Archeton

1902
00:54:14.449 --> 00:54:15.750
house once when he

1903
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.169
drove out on his motorbike or something that

1904
00:54:18.169 --> 00:54:19.860
could have been the hairy hands and they,

1905
00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:22.729
there's legends of the Middle Ages and that.

1906
00:54:23.689 --> 00:54:24.570
About 3 years ago,

1907
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.550
I did a national park walk from Belliver

1908
00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:27.689
in the afternoon.

1909
00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:30.870
I was driving along quite steadily.

1910
00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:33.560
Southwards back coming back home

1911
00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:34.719
and

1912
00:54:34.979 --> 00:54:37.399
I was about 200 yards short

1913
00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:40.199
of a brow of a hill leading down to Cherry Brook Bridge.

1914
00:54:40.919 --> 00:54:41.850
And all of a sudden my,

1915
00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040
my wheel went loose.

1916
00:54:43.729 --> 00:54:44.110
And

1917
00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.070
I do a lot of my own repairs so I thought,

1918
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:46.530
gosh,

1919
00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:47.949
my track rods dropped off,

1920
00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:48.199
you know,

1921
00:54:48.229 --> 00:54:48.909
a track rod,

1922
00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.250
it joins your steering column to your wheels.

1923
00:54:51.899 --> 00:54:52.219
I thought,

1924
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:52.659
gosh,

1925
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:53.820
I could move it like that,

1926
00:54:53.939 --> 00:54:55.000
so I was slowing up,

1927
00:54:55.179 --> 00:54:55.879
no panic.

1928
00:54:56.669 --> 00:54:57.679
Because I'm like that,

1929
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:57.959
I,

1930
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.979
I'm pretty steady,

1931
00:54:59.040 --> 00:54:59.600
you know,

1932
00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.580
um,

1933
00:55:00.959 --> 00:55:03.250
and I was slowing up and I'd almost stopped

1934
00:55:03.399 --> 00:55:04.310
and it came back again,

1935
00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.719
it must have been oh what,

1936
00:55:05.949 --> 00:55:07.159
10 seconds really.

1937
00:55:07.479 --> 00:55:08.219
It came back.

1938
00:55:08.929 --> 00:55:09.610
When I got home,

1939
00:55:09.649 --> 00:55:10.070
I thought,

1940
00:55:11.209 --> 00:55:12.070
That's funny.

1941
00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:14.209
I wonder where the hairy hands is.

1942
00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.530
I thought it was down at the bridge.

1943
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:15.810
Anyhow,

1944
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:16.689
I looked up crossing,

1945
00:55:16.729 --> 00:55:17.379
and he said,

1946
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.790
about 200 yards before the brow of a hill.

1947
00:55:20.969 --> 00:55:21.429
No.

1948
00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.270
What do you make of that then?

1949
00:55:25.669 --> 00:55:26.790
Now what I would like to do,

1950
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:29.229
I'm in contact with a very good doser expert,

1951
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:29.830
Alan Neil.

1952
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:30.669
You may have heard of him.

1953
00:55:31.139 --> 00:55:31.219
Have you?

1954
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:31.709
Oh,

1955
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.590
I'm friendly with him.

1956
00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.050
He's come out a couple of times

1957
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:35.889
on discoveries.

1958
00:55:36.149 --> 00:55:36.550
Um,

1959
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.540
he wants to go back and I want to go back to see what kind of track.

1960
00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.340
Now,

1961
00:55:42.399 --> 00:55:43.919
is it connected to the Lichway,

1962
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.979
you know the Lichway?

1963
00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.060
It's the way of the dead connecting Lydford Church to

1964
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:48.870
the little

1965
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.560
hamlets in the centre of Dartmoor,

1966
00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.520
because when anybody died in the centre of Dartmoor,

1967
00:55:53.919 --> 00:55:55.060
they had to carry them,

1968
00:55:55.479 --> 00:55:55.639
uh,

1969
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.340
had to carry the coffin all the way

1970
00:55:57.639 --> 00:55:58.459
up to

1971
00:55:58.719 --> 00:56:00.120
Lydford Church and then in.

1972
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:03.739
12:40 I think it was Bishop Branscombe

1973
00:56:04.139 --> 00:56:05.739
gave a dispensation.

1974
00:56:05.889 --> 00:56:08.939
Instead of going 22 miles to carry the coffin to Lydford,

1975
00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:10.629
they could do about 15 and

1976
00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.399
take them the other way to Widdecombe.

1977
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.280
So

1978
00:56:13.659 --> 00:56:14.860
is it anything to do with that?

1979
00:56:14.939 --> 00:56:16.100
It isn't where the lid,

1980
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.639
the lichway's been for the last 100 years.

1981
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.149
It's the Lynford,

1982
00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:24.709
the Lichway has slightly been altered recently by the forestry.

1983
00:56:25.189 --> 00:56:27.659
Is it possible that was where the Lichway once crossed?

1984
00:56:27.669 --> 00:56:28.250
I don't know.

1985
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:29.560
Hm.

1986
00:56:30.229 --> 00:56:31.870
But interesting is that the first

1987
00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.830
of those sort of experiences you've ever had?

1988
00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:35.209
That's the only

1989
00:56:35.639 --> 00:56:37.429
that kind of experience I've ever had.

1990
00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:38.090
Uh,

1991
00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:42.560
another interesting experience I've had is this must be going back 2025,

1992
00:56:42.669 --> 00:56:43.830
maybe 30 years.

1993
00:56:44.229 --> 00:56:45.090
I was up

1994
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:46.290
above

1995
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.889
two bridges.

1996
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.699
I was well up Dorford Longerford Tor.

1997
00:56:50.709 --> 00:56:52.540
I was somewhere near Lower White Tor

1998
00:56:53.229 --> 00:56:53.709
and

1999
00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.860
Was there somebody with me?

2000
00:56:55.899 --> 00:56:57.540
I think there may have been that day,

2001
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:59.020
a couple of couple of us.

2002
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.250
And I found uh,

2003
00:57:02.129 --> 00:57:02.610
Is that you,

2004
00:57:02.729 --> 00:57:03.090
Bonnie?

2005
00:57:03.209 --> 00:57:03.419
Aye,

2006
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.770
aye,

2007
00:57:03.929 --> 00:57:04.429
lie down.

2008
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:06.120
Sorry.

2009
00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:07.340
Yeah,

2010
00:57:07.489 --> 00:57:07.870
but it's

2011
00:57:08.659 --> 00:57:08.899
Bonnie,

2012
00:57:08.979 --> 00:57:10.879
you've got to go out because I'm speaking.

2013
00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:11.620
All right.

2014
00:57:11.939 --> 00:57:12.399
Go out,

2015
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:13.580
go out to see Olive.

2016
00:57:13.699 --> 00:57:14.000
No,

2017
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:14.699
come on,

2018
00:57:15.179 --> 00:57:16.020
come on this way,

2019
00:57:16.459 --> 00:57:17.040
this way.

2020
00:57:17.419 --> 00:57:17.699
Yeah.

2021
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:18.860
Um,

2022
00:57:19.189 --> 00:57:20.090
I was going up,

2023
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:20.520
uh,

2024
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.120
the yellow and white tour there

2025
00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.139
and I came,

2026
00:57:23.209 --> 00:57:24.300
I've heard about it.

2027
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:25.070
You all right?

2028
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:25.580
I,

2029
00:57:25.699 --> 00:57:26.840
I've heard about it,

2030
00:57:27.139 --> 00:57:29.500
but I've never experienced it before.

2031
00:57:29.939 --> 00:57:32.840
There was a circle of about 10 to 15

2032
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:33.969
animals,

2033
00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:34.719
cattle

2034
00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:35.840
in a circle.

2035
00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.510
And in the middle

2036
00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:38.310
was

2037
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:39.489
a wounded one

2038
00:57:39.969 --> 00:57:42.159
or it was sick or something and they were taken in

2039
00:57:42.169 --> 00:57:44.629
in turns to charge them and try to kill it.

2040
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:46.790
Now I've heard of them doing it,

2041
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:48.590
but it's the only time

2042
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:49.389
I've ever seen it.

2043
00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:50.419
Cattle,

2044
00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:50.760
yeah.

2045
00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:52.479
I've heard that animals do that,

2046
00:57:52.489 --> 00:57:53.610
they kind of form.

2047
00:57:54.229 --> 00:57:57.270
a village meeting kind of thing and and decide that

2048
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.189
the animal should be put out of its misery.

2049
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:00.280
What was wrong with it,

2050
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:00.709
I don't know,

2051
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.379
but that's the first time I've ever seen that.

2052
00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:02.800
Interesting.

2053
00:58:03.669 --> 00:58:06.530
We've had some very interesting on night walks.

2054
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:07.750
We had

2055
00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:10.620
One night when we were up at,

2056
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.820
this was on the 31st of

2057
00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.370
November I think or 30th,

2058
00:58:14.489 --> 00:58:16.750
no 30th of October or something about that.

2059
00:58:17.659 --> 00:58:19.320
About 25 years ago

2060
00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.379
and uh

2061
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.989
We were having our coffee and soup

2062
00:58:23.649 --> 00:58:24.649
at Cro Tour,

2063
00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.330
there's.

2064
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.290
Up above um.

2065
00:58:28.399 --> 00:58:30.370
Dart me to um to bridges again.

2066
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:33.790
And all of a sudden somebody said look there,

2067
00:58:33.909 --> 00:58:35.219
and there was a young vixen.

2068
00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:37.189
And he came up close,

2069
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:38.689
he came up close to us

2070
00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:39.679
and

2071
00:58:40.889 --> 00:58:44.669
One of those nights I said I've taken so many pictures I won't take my camera.

2072
00:58:45.129 --> 00:58:45.459
Luckily,

2073
00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.389
unbeknown to me,

2074
00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.189
one of the members of my class.

2075
00:58:48.899 --> 00:58:48.909
He

2076
00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:49.550
was a

2077
00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.320
Western Morning News photographer,

2078
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.120
so he took some photographs

2079
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:53.810
and

2080
00:58:54.669 --> 00:58:56.340
She never flinched when the flash went.

2081
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:57.429
Now what we kept out,

2082
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:59.290
we had the picture published in the paper,

2083
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:00.870
but what we kept out of a paper,

2084
00:59:00.949 --> 00:59:02.409
we had the dog fox as well.

2085
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.929
Now the late Mister Hurrell said that

2086
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:08.310
the vixen must have been hand reared at some time and then

2087
00:59:08.469 --> 00:59:09.389
liberated

2088
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:11.100
because she wasn't nervous,

2089
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:13.600
but the dog fox would scatter every time the flash went.

2090
00:59:13.669 --> 00:59:14.489
We had to wait,

2091
00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:15.550
um.

2092
00:59:16.389 --> 00:59:17.000
So interesting,

2093
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:17.810
the vixen.

2094
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.669
would almost take food from her hands.

2095
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:23.000
Um,

2096
00:59:23.439 --> 00:59:23.979
they

2097
00:59:24.679 --> 00:59:25.750
It didn't like

2098
00:59:25.969 --> 00:59:26.770
Madeira cake,

2099
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.929
but it liked currant cake.

2100
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.449
um I've only got one picture now,

2101
00:59:30.489 --> 00:59:32.010
unfortunately I forgot

2102
00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:32.649
that the,

2103
00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.120
People that interviewed me yesterday

2104
00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:35.840
took away

2105
00:59:36.219 --> 00:59:37.739
the piece that was published in the paper,

2106
00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:38.879
but that's the vixen.

2107
00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.199
And in fact one picture I've got somewhere

2108
00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:43.919
is of the

2109
00:59:44.169 --> 00:59:44.919
vixen

2110
00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.620
almost touching the toes of a young girl that was with us.

2111
00:59:48.699 --> 00:59:49.770
There were several young

2112
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.580
children there and uh

2113
00:59:52.159 --> 00:59:54.189
very unusual to be so close.

2114
00:59:54.659 --> 00:59:54.850
Yeah,

2115
00:59:54.979 --> 00:59:55.959
we think it must have been,

2116
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:56.179
you know,

2117
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.010
hand reared and,

2118
00:59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.199
but it had mated with the dog and the two over there.

2119
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.379
It's a marvellous.

2120
01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:03.820
We got fed up before

2121
01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:04.469
they,

2122
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.459
they stayed there all the time.

2123
01:00:08.199 --> 01:00:08.699
So

2124
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:09.560
how,

2125
01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:09.840
I mean,

2126
01:00:09.879 --> 01:00:10.439
you've been,

2127
01:00:10.719 --> 01:00:12.659
how long have you been working on Dartmoor?

2128
01:00:14.139 --> 01:00:14.580
Walking.

2129
01:00:16.429 --> 01:00:16.449
Oh yeah,

2130
01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:16.469
on.

2131
01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:16.500
Well,

2132
01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.919
I suppose I must have started not long after,

2133
01:00:19.379 --> 01:00:20.060
say 35,

2134
01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:20.709
36.

2135
01:00:21.129 --> 01:00:21.820
So in these years,

2136
01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:22.360
what,

2137
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.199
what changes have you seen over the last

2138
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:25.879
60 years?

2139
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.459
Change it

2140
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.139
More people,

2141
01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:32.409
because I was up there a week and saw 4 people.

2142
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.909
Now you can go out and see over 100 in a day.

2143
01:00:36.209 --> 01:00:36.889
Um,

2144
01:00:38.739 --> 01:00:40.360
The other big change is

2145
01:00:42.199 --> 01:00:42.649
The pub,

2146
01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
I suppose the effects of the public,

2147
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.889
the public are not so,

2148
01:00:47.239 --> 01:00:48.159
what's the word,

2149
01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:49.280
sympathetic.

2150
01:00:50.149 --> 01:00:51.229
To landscape,

2151
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.570
they're not so sympathetic to the lives of

2152
01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:54.590
people who live there,

2153
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.590
farmers and that,

2154
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:56.429
uh,

2155
01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.939
even though if I'm going into a farm area,

2156
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.429
and I want to look at something,

2157
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:02.689
even though it may be public,

2158
01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.989
I still ring a farmer up and ask,

2159
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:05.909
and I say,

2160
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.409
do you mind me going and look

2161
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.040
at so and so,

2162
01:01:09.469 --> 01:01:10.669
I always ring them up,

2163
01:01:10.989 --> 01:01:11.510
um.

2164
01:01:13.909 --> 01:01:15.989
One thing that annoys me is

2165
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.620
The lack of responsibility,

2166
01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:19.469
um.

2167
01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.100
Mountain bikes are a curse.

2168
01:01:23.699 --> 01:01:24.100
I,

2169
01:01:24.219 --> 01:01:25.820
3 years ago in the winter,

2170
01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:28.280
I went from Shapley Common to

2171
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.659
Grimspond and up to Hamilton.

2172
01:01:31.389 --> 01:01:33.360
And one bike of snow,

2173
01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:34.750
light snow was on the ground,

2174
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.870
and one bush,

2175
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.929
one mountain bike had been along,

2176
01:01:38.229 --> 01:01:39.610
and the skid marks

2177
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:40.610
and

2178
01:01:40.949 --> 01:01:42.870
to my mind damage on a.

2179
01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:44.860
Where people walk,

2180
01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:46.310
you could see this

2181
01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:50.100
skid marks and ruts and everything where he'd been along and back,

2182
01:01:50.149 --> 01:01:51.020
one person.

2183
01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:52.750
You get people,

2184
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.290
they will go off where they're allowed to go,

2185
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:56.770
they go on the open moor,

2186
01:01:57.169 --> 01:01:58.179
another person follows,

2187
01:01:58.290 --> 01:01:59.419
then another follows,

2188
01:01:59.729 --> 01:02:00.909
and it's wearing away.

2189
01:02:01.939 --> 01:02:02.820
That's one,

2190
01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.199
the other is

2191
01:02:05.419 --> 01:02:05.939
theft.

2192
01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:08.000
Theft and damage.

2193
01:02:08.149 --> 01:02:08.600
First of all,

2194
01:02:08.679 --> 01:02:10.739
I think there's 3 kiss veins now have been

2195
01:02:10.879 --> 01:02:13.110
badly damaged by people lighting fires,

2196
01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:13.899
which is,

2197
01:02:14.239 --> 01:02:15.830
is against the law anyhow,

2198
01:02:16.239 --> 01:02:19.699
where you have stones of a kissed vein being shattered by heat.

2199
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:22.090
Uh,

2200
01:02:22.219 --> 01:02:22.850
theft,

2201
01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:24.169
quite a few thefts.

2202
01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:24.590
Uh,

2203
01:02:24.689 --> 01:02:26.189
the first one I knew about.

2204
01:02:26.949 --> 01:02:28.510
Well there's several I've heard rumours,

2205
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.449
but there's no,

2206
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:33.030
you can't prove that a certain person's taken a certain object.

2207
01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:36.590
But the first nasty one was a takeoff stone near Lydford.

2208
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.110
Now a takeoff stone

2209
01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.850
is put in by the toll

2210
01:02:41.350 --> 01:02:42.409
on the toll road,

2211
01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:43.510
uh.

2212
01:02:44.709 --> 01:02:45.989
If you've got a steep hill,

2213
01:02:46.239 --> 01:02:47.080
an animal,

2214
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.709
you,

2215
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.120
they charge you so much for a horse and cart.

2216
01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:51.889
And you can take

2217
01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.560
On the toll road you can go through with your horse and cart,

2218
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.979
but because it's a steep hill you can put another animal on the help.

2219
01:02:59.520 --> 01:02:59.820
But

2220
01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.070
because you don't pay for it,

2221
01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.510
you've got to take it off because they,

2222
01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:04.110
when they get to the takeoff stone,

2223
01:03:04.679 --> 01:03:05.479
that was the idea of that.

2224
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.899
Now that one at Lydford

2225
01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:07.800
I've known.

2226
01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.129
Grigsby since the war,

2227
01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:11.219
uh,

2228
01:03:11.229 --> 01:03:13.510
Jane March had asked me to send a photograph when they,

2229
01:03:13.649 --> 01:03:15.510
they made a duplicate now and put there,

2230
01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:16.729
but it isn't the same.

2231
01:03:17.909 --> 01:03:18.870
Somebody's stole the hat.

2232
01:03:19.149 --> 01:03:20.669
We think they're doing it to order now.

2233
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.149
People say,

2234
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.110
Can you get me something?

2235
01:03:22.229 --> 01:03:23.370
We'll pay you so much.

2236
01:03:24.590 --> 01:03:24.840
Uh,

2237
01:03:24.919 --> 01:03:26.100
there's a big trough

2238
01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.600
being taken one night.

2239
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:31.090
East side of a moor somewhere when they say there

2240
01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.229
must have been a crane and a lorry came along,

2241
01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:34.750
dug this up and took it away.

2242
01:03:35.689 --> 01:03:36.750
Things are vanishing,

2243
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.310
and a lot of things have vanished from

2244
01:03:39.699 --> 01:03:40.850
places on the moor.

2245
01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:43.260
That's terrible.

2246
01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.909
How do you feel about the

2247
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.110
numbers of people that that use them all now?

2248
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:47.580
I mean,

2249
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.550
in your early days,

2250
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.639
you're the only person there,

2251
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:51.120
very different experience.

2252
01:03:51.199 --> 01:03:51.879
I actually imagine.

2253
01:03:51.919 --> 01:03:52.739
You could walk

2254
01:03:52.959 --> 01:03:54.300
all day and never see anybody.

2255
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:57.449
This is a different,

2256
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.590
we've got somehow to manage it.

2257
01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:00.570
I mean,

2258
01:04:00.659 --> 01:04:00.739
the,

2259
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:01.600
in a way,

2260
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:02.070
the

2261
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.489
foot and mouth was a blessing.

2262
01:04:04.199 --> 01:04:06.679
But within within a week of it being open again,

2263
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.040
one of the things that I

2264
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.520
wish we could get rid of is the military.

2265
01:04:11.409 --> 01:04:11.879
Now,

2266
01:04:12.409 --> 01:04:14.129
not so much the firing areas first.

2267
01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:16.090
Let's get them out the other areas

2268
01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:16.629
now.

2269
01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:18.449
It annoyed me to go to Drizzlecombe,

2270
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.649
this lovely

2271
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.030
arrangement of three burials

2272
01:04:22.209 --> 01:04:22.530
in a,

2273
01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:23.040
in,

2274
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:24.189
in a line.

2275
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:25.560
From each one,

2276
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:26.689
from the right hand one,

2277
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.030
there was a line of stones,

2278
01:04:28.169 --> 01:04:29.149
and men here,

2279
01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:29.889
a gap,

2280
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.889
another burial,

2281
01:04:31.209 --> 01:04:32.669
a line of stones again

2282
01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.739
to a men to another men here.

2283
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.070
So that was one side.

2284
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:37.790
In the middle we had

2285
01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:40.159
a line of stones to a shorter row,

2286
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.010
to a men here.

2287
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.449
And on the left

2288
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:43.649
there was nothing

2289
01:04:44.149 --> 01:04:45.179
as if it hadn't finished,

2290
01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:45.649
but

2291
01:04:45.909 --> 01:04:48.949
right opposite the bottom men here of that side.

2292
01:04:50.409 --> 01:04:51.520
Exact place is a marker stone,

2293
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:53.449
as if we were going to do that and never finished.

2294
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.219
Now I was out there

2295
01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.000
just after the foot and mouth.

2296
01:04:57.879 --> 01:04:58.669
And 100,

2297
01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:00.810
about 100 soldiers came yoning up.

2298
01:05:01.639 --> 01:05:02.419
Same track

2299
01:05:02.919 --> 01:05:03.560
a little bit later,

2300
01:05:03.719 --> 01:05:04.120
not a lot,

2301
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.139
same path.

2302
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.770
All outside the firing area,

2303
01:05:07.889 --> 01:05:10.610
why can't they do all their training in the firing area?

2304
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:11.189
I know

2305
01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:12.750
everybody wants them off completely,

2306
01:05:12.889 --> 01:05:13.320
that's,

2307
01:05:13.449 --> 01:05:14.310
that's the ultimate,

2308
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:14.810
I think.

2309
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:16.280
They don't need to train here,

2310
01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.189
they could go into the wilds of Scotland

2311
01:05:18.889 --> 01:05:19.350
where

2312
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:20.149
there are no

2313
01:05:21.669 --> 01:05:23.050
archi archaeological remains.

2314
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:25.000
But

2315
01:05:25.439 --> 01:05:26.520
it's just the pressure,

2316
01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:27.080
there's not,

2317
01:05:27.239 --> 01:05:28.780
if we could cut down the amount of pressure,

2318
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:29.929
and I do feel that

2319
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.840
their their er military vehicles and er the troops,

2320
01:05:34.199 --> 01:05:35.389
especially carrying full kit,

2321
01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:36.169
they're a weight,

2322
01:05:36.719 --> 01:05:37.199
um.

2323
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:40.100
And then setting up wireless stations,

2324
01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:41.070
setting up

2325
01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:42.449
camp and all that.

2326
01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.830
It's an unnecessary burden

2327
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:45.969
because

2328
01:05:46.229 --> 01:05:46.500
they're,

2329
01:05:46.629 --> 01:05:49.320
they've got equipment which an ordinary hiker hasn't.

2330
01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.290
But as regards the ordinary

2331
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:51.969
person.

2332
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:54.750
It's education,

2333
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:55.350
I think.

2334
01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:56.090
I

2335
01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:57.000
had a

2336
01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.489
difficult time,

2337
01:05:58.949 --> 01:05:59.739
about 3 years ago,

2338
01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.110
I was out near Pew Tow.

2339
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:07.479
And I found a man helping his children to block up a waterway where there was a

2340
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:09.229
particular notice that said

2341
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:11.489
Do not obstruct this

2342
01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:12.590
waterway,

2343
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:14.469
it's drinking water or something like that,

2344
01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:15.850
there was a notice saying

2345
01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.669
do not obstruct this,

2346
01:06:17.959 --> 01:06:20.699
and if my brother-in-law hadn't been there with his friend,

2347
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:21.550
I think he would have,

2348
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:22.790
he would have bashed me.

2349
01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.169
Because I just pointed out that

2350
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.379
did they realise that this was somebody's water supply,

2351
01:06:29.919 --> 01:06:30.270
and he said,

2352
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:30.479
oh,

2353
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.979
we can do what we like out here don't you tell me

2354
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.080
and his wife couldn't even restrain him.

2355
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.429
And his wife apologised to me afterwards.

2356
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.010
I mean,

2357
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:40.929
you've got

2358
01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:42.629
people that do not respect

2359
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:43.850
the Dartmoor.

2360
01:06:44.090 --> 01:06:46.649
If people respected it and learned more about it.

2361
01:06:47.389 --> 01:06:48.469
I think it'd be a great help,

2362
01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:48.929
but

2363
01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:49.949
how do you do it?

2364
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.800
You get so many people.

2365
01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:54.229
On the other hand,

2366
01:06:54.290 --> 01:06:56.350
it's very rewarding at time I had.

2367
01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.030
A party,

2368
01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.229
must be

2369
01:06:59.399 --> 01:07:00.909
15 years ago now,

2370
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.310
a party of children came down from Bristol.

2371
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.139
And I was told they were deprived children.

2372
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:06.629
I thought,

2373
01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:07.020
hm.

2374
01:07:09.169 --> 01:07:10.000
See how things go.

2375
01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.399
Anyhow,

2376
01:07:10.439 --> 01:07:11.179
when they came.

2377
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.229
They all had the most expensive

2378
01:07:14.629 --> 01:07:15.629
equipment.

2379
01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:17.649
Wellington's all brand new,

2380
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:18.629
all brand new

2381
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:20.389
anorak and everything.

2382
01:07:20.649 --> 01:07:23.110
They were deprived because they'd never seen the country.

2383
01:07:24.659 --> 01:07:26.300
And the teacher said,

2384
01:07:26.649 --> 01:07:27.209
do you know,

2385
01:07:27.469 --> 01:07:27.899
she said,

2386
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:29.290
most of these children

2387
01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.199
have never been out of Bristol.

2388
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:32.840
Their parents are too

2389
01:07:33.179 --> 01:07:34.760
hard at work earning money

2390
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.540
that they can't afford the time.

2391
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.389
We had a plan what to do that day.

2392
01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:41.550
We just left it.

2393
01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:43.729
They were so happy.

2394
01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.939
Just playing around on the grass,

2395
01:07:48.229 --> 01:07:48.989
jumping the stream,

2396
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:49.750
getting wet.

2397
01:07:52.719 --> 01:07:54.100
So there's still people

2398
01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.330
that can appreciate it,

2399
01:07:55.399 --> 01:07:56.439
but so many,

2400
01:07:56.479 --> 01:07:56.879
there's.

2401
01:07:58.719 --> 01:07:59.270
Um,

2402
01:07:59.360 --> 01:07:59.750
no,

2403
01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.629
then you come to letterboxes.

2404
01:08:03.139 --> 01:08:05.469
I believe in about 6 letterboxes,

2405
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.620
which were the originals.

2406
01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:08.260
But

2407
01:08:09.439 --> 01:08:10.520
It's all right.

2408
01:08:10.979 --> 01:08:12.979
The only trouble is that they all

2409
01:08:13.199 --> 01:08:14.879
have books now telling you

2410
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.209
not just a map reference,

2411
01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.279
but how to find them.

2412
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.640
And that means when you're out walking,

2413
01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.520
you find a track.

2414
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:20.839
Oh,

2415
01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:22.370
there must be a letterbox there.

2416
01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.189
There's these tracks everywhere,

2417
01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.279
whereas we tend to try to ease.

2418
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:28.919
The damage to the vegetation.

2419
01:08:31.219 --> 01:08:32.179
What do you do with people,

2420
01:08:32.219 --> 01:08:34.398
it's going to be more and more people in the future.

2421
01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:37.149
I think

2422
01:08:37.259 --> 01:08:39.549
education in respect is the only answer.

2423
01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:41.839
Lovely.

2424
01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:43.479
Now,

2425
01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.100
what else?

2426
01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:46.069
So what's your motivation to,

2427
01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:46.310
uh,

2428
01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.990
what is it that that gets you,

2429
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.459
keeps you going out there at night

2430
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:50.720
at your age?

2431
01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:51.680
How old are you now?

2432
01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:53.040
7777.

2433
01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:54.390
Almost,

2434
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:55.310
almost 78,

2435
01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.279
uh,

2436
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:57.799
just the love of doing it,

2437
01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:58.600
showing other people,

2438
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.140
I suppose.

2439
01:09:00.889 --> 01:09:01.139
When,

2440
01:09:01.258 --> 01:09:03.627
when there's a walk and nobody turns up,

2441
01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:04.448
uh,

2442
01:09:04.568 --> 01:09:05.758
luckily that's not a night walk,

2443
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.488
that's usually a daytime national park.

2444
01:09:07.568 --> 01:09:08.908
It doesn't happen often,

2445
01:09:09.448 --> 01:09:09.969
um.

2446
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.040
I'm really quite

2447
01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:15.330
I'm,

2448
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.330
I'm at wit's end,

2449
01:09:16.419 --> 01:09:17.029
what to do,

2450
01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:18.060
what do I do now?

2451
01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:20.430
So quite often I go out for a walk on my own.

2452
01:09:20.509 --> 01:09:20.750
I think,

2453
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:21.049
oh,

2454
01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:21.580
I'm up here,

2455
01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:23.609
I'll look for something I haven't seen or

2456
01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:24.549
something like that.

2457
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.560
So do you think you'll continue doing it?

2458
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.709
How long?

2459
01:09:29.719 --> 01:09:29.828
Well,

2460
01:09:29.877 --> 01:09:30.519
at least 80,

2461
01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:30.957
I hope.

2462
01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:32.930
Um,

2463
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.790
I don't know if this chap could go back in '96.

2464
01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:37.549
No,

2465
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.399
it's just as long as I feel I can do it.

2466
01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:40.729
Um,

2467
01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:42.759
They can still tell to me.

2468
01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:43.200
I've had,

2469
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.660
I had a young lady a couple of years ago and said to me,

2470
01:09:46.679 --> 01:09:47.758
Could you go a bit slower,

2471
01:09:47.877 --> 01:09:48.538
she said.

2472
01:09:49.078 --> 01:09:49.479
I'm

2473
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.439
I go to a gym 2 or 3 times a week,

2474
01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:53.200
I do jogging,

2475
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.660
but I can't keep up with you.

2476
01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:56.729
Um

2477
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.620
No,

2478
01:09:59.009 --> 01:10:00.580
I've got a very good group now.

2479
01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:04.100
See Friday we'll be up and down banks and

2480
01:10:04.279 --> 01:10:06.060
crawling through places and

2481
01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:08.020
so you don't see yourself giving up yet?

2482
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:08.839
No,

2483
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.160
no,

2484
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:09.500
I,

2485
01:10:09.839 --> 01:10:11.479
well I can still do it and feel fit.

2486
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.100
The only thing now,

2487
01:10:14.359 --> 01:10:18.040
I don't mind doing 2 days running or anything like that or even 2 in the same day.

2488
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:18.990
I've done a morning,

2489
01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.029
I've done a morning one.

2490
01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.439
I've done a night walk as well.

2491
01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:23.620
The only thing I make

2492
01:10:23.959 --> 01:10:25.240
sure to the national park,

2493
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:27.379
no two days consecutive,

2494
01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.700
because if I have 2 walks

2495
01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:30.189
on a,

2496
01:10:30.279 --> 01:10:30.390
say,

2497
01:10:30.399 --> 01:10:31.080
a Monday.

2498
01:10:32.009 --> 01:10:33.049
And it's raining.

2499
01:10:33.779 --> 01:10:35.680
I've only got 2 full kits,

2500
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:38.109
and I want a day in between to dry them out.

2501
01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:39.669
Excellent,

2502
01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:40.720
lovely.

2503
01:10:40.979 --> 01:10:41.060
Well,

2504
01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.220
thanks a lot Ted for your time.

2505
01:10:42.299 --> 01:10:42.419
Yeah,

2506
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:42.729
well,

2507
01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:43.220
uh,

2508
01:10:43.689 --> 01:10:44.350
anything else?

2509
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.609
What else and what else?

2510
01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:45.700
That's um.

2511
01:10:50.509 --> 01:10:50.870
By the way,

2512
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.490
it isn't just Dartmoor I do.

2513
01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:54.709
When we do our

2514
01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:56.899
after our last walk before Christmas,

2515
01:10:56.979 --> 01:10:57.379
we always,

2516
01:10:57.459 --> 01:10:59.200
I always put an extra on for charity

2517
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.359
and we go out on a moorland walk.

2518
01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.339
We sing carols around one of the stone crosses and then we go in,

2519
01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:05.799
we get invited in there

2520
01:11:05.939 --> 01:11:08.640
to have our supper inside in the counting house at Carriver Bridge.

2521
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:09.370
Uh,

2522
01:11:09.379 --> 01:11:11.680
I've got to see the new owner next week,

2523
01:11:11.979 --> 01:11:12.580
um,

2524
01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:13.419
and.

2525
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.029
Great pity.

2526
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.009
I can remember

2527
01:11:16.629 --> 01:11:17.229
when that,

2528
01:11:17.589 --> 01:11:20.810
when that was the accounts office of a mine that was working.

2529
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.620
The opposite side of the road there was a field,

2530
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:24.580
and

2531
01:11:24.759 --> 01:11:26.839
the china clay used to come down a pipe

2532
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.020
into that field,

2533
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.919
fill it up to about 3 ft depth.

2534
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:31.279
Then the sun dried it off.

2535
01:11:31.399 --> 01:11:32.620
No steam heat in them,

2536
01:11:32.959 --> 01:11:33.259
uh,

2537
01:11:33.629 --> 01:11:35.140
dried off until it was

2538
01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.339
pretty firm,

2539
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.720
and the men would come along and pick it up like peat.

2540
01:11:38.839 --> 01:11:39.339
They would

2541
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.149
do this in the wheelbarrows.

2542
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.299
Came up on a slope up to the top of the hedge

2543
01:11:44.479 --> 01:11:45.109
onto a,

2544
01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.740
a flat piece which is still there today,

2545
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:48.520
and

2546
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:50.700
Deposited in the horse carts.

2547
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:51.740
I can remember that,

2548
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.399
no photographs.le

2549
01:11:54.299 --> 01:11:54.939
wartime,

2550
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.140
everything vanished by the time things got back to normal and I was home,

2551
01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:58.819
they'd gone.

2552
01:11:59.259 --> 01:12:00.379
And this is the only survivor.

2553
01:12:00.419 --> 01:12:01.959
So I'm doing a bit of survey round,

2554
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.419
round the um counting house.

2555
01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.589
Now the counting house is,

2556
01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:06.419
oh there it is,

2557
01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.740
is a counting house.

2558
01:12:07.899 --> 01:12:11.120
So you're still looking and doing research still doing the bits.

2559
01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:11.850
um,

2560
01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:13.200
there's another one.

2561
01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:17.810
That's Discovering the Stone Road,

2562
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.229
that was in the Dartmoor magazine I wrote

2563
01:12:20.529 --> 01:12:21.229
that was.

2564
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:23.589
Discovering the stone row.

2565
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:24.620
If you want to borrow

2566
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:25.589
a couple of these,

2567
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:26.549
you can do if you like,

2568
01:12:26.589 --> 01:12:27.609
let me have them back.

2569
01:12:28.029 --> 01:12:28.490
Um,

2570
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.529
and this is the Gendel's report and I've got a bit on the end asking Jane.

2571
01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:34.890
She asked me to hold it a bit.

2572
01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.669
So I said let me know when I've got permission.

2573
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.890
Well,

2574
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:37.470
I have now,

2575
01:12:37.589 --> 01:12:41.279
so that'll be another article I'll have to update and put in.

2576
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.000
So you're still doing your research.

2577
01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:45.850
Yes,

2578
01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:46.149
you're doing.

2579
01:12:46.299 --> 01:12:46.930
Do you think you'll continue on doing it.

2580
01:12:46.939 --> 01:12:47.700
That's not deliberate.

2581
01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:50.740
That's because I find things that are happening or things that I want to do

2582
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.359
over the night walks.

2583
01:12:54.859 --> 01:12:55.379
Oh dear,

2584
01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:55.620
dear,

2585
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.279
dear.

2586
01:12:57.319 --> 01:12:57.660
Oh no,

2587
01:12:57.779 --> 01:12:58.229
there's,

2588
01:12:58.620 --> 01:12:58.740
oh,

2589
01:12:58.899 --> 01:12:59.359
another thing,

2590
01:12:59.459 --> 01:12:59.819
uh,

2591
01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.580
you might like to record a little,

2592
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.640
little bit in a minute.

2593
01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:03.879
I'll just look up the date.

2594
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:08.240
Just see if I've got the date here.

2595
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:11.290
Uh,

2596
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.479
back on the 18th of April '49,

2597
01:13:15.069 --> 01:13:15.799
I

2598
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:17.109
did a walk.

2599
01:13:19.279 --> 01:13:19.509
I,

2600
01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:19.759
yes,

2601
01:13:19.799 --> 01:13:21.160
I was on my own at the time.

2602
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:21.899
I walked up.

2603
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:25.250
From Erm Pound up the Erne Valley to Erne

2604
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:27.709
Pound and then went to Huntingdon Warren where Mr.

2605
01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.649
Symons was living.

2606
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:29.390
He was the

2607
01:13:29.649 --> 01:13:30.890
virtual hermit

2608
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.209
that um,

2609
01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:37.870
He was a Dutchy tenant and uh I believe I'm right in saying that the

2610
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.450
then Prince of Wales used to visit him on occasions.

2611
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:42.330
He

2612
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:45.569
was known I think for writing poems.

2613
01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:50.029
And I visited him this day at Hunting and More House

2614
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.040
and

2615
01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:53.509
Stayed for a cup of tea,

2616
01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:54.850
there was no sugar,

2617
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:55.740
there was no milk,

2618
01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:59.669
it was just a cup of tea and bread that was several days stale,

2619
01:14:00.129 --> 01:14:02.089
because he only used to walk all the way down to

2620
01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:05.109
Ashburton a couple of times a week to get his provisions,

2621
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:05.740
and,

2622
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:07.589
It's a funny thing,

2623
01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:08.910
I'd never

2624
01:14:09.419 --> 01:14:11.990
been back to see Huntingdon Warren House,

2625
01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:12.560
uh,

2626
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:14.149
ever since that date

2627
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.899
until about two years ago.

2628
01:14:17.109 --> 01:14:18.830
My daughter wanted to go for a walk,

2629
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:20.290
so she came up with me

2630
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:23.580
and uh we went up a different direction actually,

2631
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:27.709
but uh from Cross Furzey we went to Huntingdon Warren to look at the

2632
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:29.009
remains,

2633
01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:30.629
which are very little of the house,

2634
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:35.950
so it was something like 50 odd years in between me going back to Huntington Warren.

2635
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:39.060
It was a great shame to learn the history that,

2636
01:14:39.069 --> 01:14:39.379
uh,

2637
01:14:39.589 --> 01:14:42.279
in fact some RAF or RAF cadets had.

2638
01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:42.870
Uh,

2639
01:14:42.919 --> 01:14:46.100
at some time in the intervening period had stayed in

2640
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:47.270
the ruins and,

2641
01:14:47.279 --> 01:14:47.680
uh,

2642
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.109
or the unoccupied house and,

2643
01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:50.490
uh,

2644
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.319
inadvertently set fire to it.

2645
01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:54.500
So that was the end of Huntington Warren House.

2646
01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:57.240
So that's now just a derelict building.

2647
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.240
Just a derelict,

2648
01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:00.500
there are just little bits of the walls left and

2649
01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:01.529
it's so difficult.

2650
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.399
People ask me,

2651
01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.620
can I remember what the room looked like?

2652
01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.620
Now I took a picture as I was leaving from about half a mile away,

2653
01:15:09.879 --> 01:15:12.060
and that's the only picture I've got from those days.

2654
01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:13.529
What a shame,

2655
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:14.229
there again,

2656
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:15.669
we didn't take so many.

2657
01:15:16.109 --> 01:15:17.629
What a shame I didn't take one.

2658
01:15:18.979 --> 01:15:19.209
You know,

2659
01:15:19.259 --> 01:15:19.879
in the house,

2660
01:15:20.339 --> 01:15:20.779
there again,

2661
01:15:20.819 --> 01:15:21.520
I remember,

2662
01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.279
I think the only

2663
01:15:23.569 --> 01:15:25.500
films we could get then

2664
01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.720
were XRAF films with 6 of them

2665
01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:31.930
and of course they were very dear getting them developed.

2666
01:15:31.979 --> 01:15:34.359
It cost about 1 and 6 months to develop

2667
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:36.419
and to for a

2668
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.200
postcard enlargement.

2669
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:38.759
But uh

2670
01:15:39.859 --> 01:15:40.140
that's,

2671
01:15:40.259 --> 01:15:41.299
that's all at the moment.

2672
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:41.799
I'll

2673
01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.339
just show you I've got.

2674
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:47.669
I've got one of,

2675
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:49.810
I think I've got Huntington's or on here.

2676
01:15:51.359 --> 01:15:53.700
Well this is some of the equipment I've seen moving to,

2677
01:15:54.279 --> 01:15:56.479
pumping equipment by flat rods.

2678
01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:58.140
Kind of a bridge,

2679
01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:58.930
you see.

2680
01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.270
Um,

2681
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.419
let's see if I can see this one of hunting.

2682
01:16:06.549 --> 01:16:07.660
That's that's recent,

2683
01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.660
that's recent work with um

2684
01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:10.859
Jane Marchant.

2685
01:16:17.779 --> 01:16:17.939
Ah,

2686
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:18.620
it is

2687
01:16:21.379 --> 01:16:23.200
That's a picture I took in '49,

2688
01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:24.649
there's Hunting Warren House.

2689
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:27.540
In the distance.

2690
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:32.029
Yeah,

2691
01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:33.029
a long time to remember back,

2692
01:16:33.069 --> 01:16:33.379
isn't it?

2693
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:35.819
And you've sat in probably many people's kitchens having a cup of tea.

2694
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:38.100
Why would you remember specifically what that one looked like?

2695
01:16:38.589 --> 01:16:38.870
I mean,

2696
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:40.029
I remembered we chatted,

2697
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:42.109
we must have been there chatting about 1 hour,

2698
01:16:42.189 --> 01:16:42.970
you know,

2699
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:44.209
and funny,

2700
01:16:44.509 --> 01:16:45.450
never been back again,

2701
01:16:45.509 --> 01:16:45.939
you know.

2702
01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:48.700
So much.

2703
01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:50.220
This is the attraction of Dartmoor.

2704
01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:51.799
There's so much to see and do.

2705
01:16:52.759 --> 01:16:53.259
Excellent.

2706
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:54.359
Well,

2707
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.520
absolutely fascinating,

2708
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:55.919
Ted.

2709
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:59.160
I mean I had lunch on the banks of the Plym

2710
01:16:59.509 --> 01:17:01.939
further up the valley up well into the moor

2711
01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.439
and out of a mist came a black mink.

2712
01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:05.830
And it,

2713
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.819
it would

2714
01:17:07.169 --> 01:17:09.439
came around the back of us and it walked all around us,

2715
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.359
jumped into the,

2716
01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.600
jumped into the river,

2717
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:12.680
swam up and down,

2718
01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:13.279
got out,

2719
01:17:13.399 --> 01:17:15.770
came round us and it was with us about half an hour.

2720
01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:19.209
This was,

2721
01:17:19.529 --> 01:17:19.850
let's see,

2722
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:21.109
this is going back.

2723
01:17:24.359 --> 01:17:26.229
About 30 odd years ago,

2724
01:17:28.439 --> 01:17:28.919
must have been,

2725
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.200
yes,

2726
01:17:29.279 --> 01:17:30.740
or early 70s

2727
01:17:30.919 --> 01:17:31.799
and um.

2728
01:17:33.759 --> 01:17:35.620
Because Hurrell was alive.

2729
01:17:35.879 --> 01:17:36.120
Oh no,

2730
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:37.120
it was his son Tommy,

2731
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:37.509
that's right,

2732
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:38.009
his son said,

2733
01:17:38.319 --> 01:17:39.419
said to me,

2734
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:39.750
oh,

2735
01:17:39.759 --> 01:17:41.240
it must have been on transit,

2736
01:17:41.279 --> 01:17:42.410
it wouldn't have lived there.

2737
01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:44.189
So you're not likely to see it again.

2738
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.700
I've never seen one since.

2739
01:17:46.279 --> 01:17:46.759
Um,

2740
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.200
got a bit scared.

2741
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.299
So that nobody had a camera.

2742
01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.350
That's always a way,

2743
01:17:51.359 --> 01:17:52.060
isn't it?

2744
01:17:52.839 --> 01:17:54.839
Then we had a day of terrific storm.

2745
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.180
We were on the moors

2746
01:17:56.399 --> 01:17:57.000
one night.

2747
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.640
No,

2748
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.709
no,

2749
01:17:58.759 --> 01:17:59.390
it was daytime.

2750
01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:00.990
We had a terrific storm

2751
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:03.370
and uh this was WEA again

2752
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:04.450
and uh

2753
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:06.350
it was so bad that uh.

2754
01:18:07.330 --> 01:18:11.049
Must have been somebody lost a helicopter came down near us and

2755
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.310
looked at us all and then took off again,

2756
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.740
so.

2757
01:18:14.839 --> 01:18:15.729
We were so bad we couldn't,

2758
01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:16.479
we had cameras,

2759
01:18:16.569 --> 01:18:17.810
couldn't even use them that day.

2760
01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:18.890
We must have seen some,

2761
01:18:19.169 --> 01:18:20.819
some weather out there on the moors.

2762
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:21.049
Yes,

2763
01:18:21.339 --> 01:18:21.779
I.

2764
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:23.879
About 10 years ago,

2765
01:18:23.899 --> 01:18:25.660
I was doing the national park walk and there

2766
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.310
was a chap there that was an experienced sailor,

2767
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.240
and we were up above Grimm's Pond

2768
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.029
and

2769
01:18:32.339 --> 01:18:33.560
the rain was coming up,

2770
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.560
sweeping up the valley and up,

2771
01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:38.740
and we were blown over several times and he said,

2772
01:18:38.779 --> 01:18:41.220
I reckon this wind's near enough 100 miles an hour.

2773
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:44.029
Then of course the ice.

2774
01:18:44.879 --> 01:18:46.299
We've had fun with the ice,

2775
01:18:46.959 --> 01:18:47.899
many times.

2776
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:51.560
The equipment that you have must have changed somewhat since you started.

2777
01:18:51.689 --> 01:18:52.220
Yes.

2778
01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:54.259
When I started,

2779
01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:55.240
you couldn't get.

2780
01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:56.790
At a reasonable price,

2781
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:58.859
any walking boots,

2782
01:18:58.939 --> 01:19:01.060
so we had farm rubber boots,

2783
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.020
then we went on to

2784
01:19:03.419 --> 01:19:04.520
hiking boots,

2785
01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:05.470
uh,

2786
01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.790
the equipment,

2787
01:19:07.339 --> 01:19:08.120
I think

2788
01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:11.490
in a way the equipment has got a lot better and cheaper.

2789
01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.020
I know people will spend 100,

2790
01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:14.580
150 pounds on something,

2791
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.549
but I don't.

2792
01:19:15.939 --> 01:19:16.399
I

2793
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.399
find that if you spend a lot,

2794
01:19:18.919 --> 01:19:21.319
They'll go in a place and the whole lot's ruined,

2795
01:19:21.399 --> 01:19:23.629
so I tend to buy the cheaper end of a scale,

2796
01:19:23.879 --> 01:19:25.100
but I've got some very nice

2797
01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.299
leggings now that you can sit.

2798
01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:28.979
That used to be my bugbear,

2799
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:30.700
stopping

2800
01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.600
when there's a sudden rain or hail or anything

2801
01:19:33.839 --> 01:19:35.060
to put leggings on,

2802
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.919
taking your boots off and putting leggings on.

2803
01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.660
Now they've got the zip on the back,

2804
01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:39.879
and they're virtually

2805
01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.160
as cheap as the old fashioned leggings were.

2806
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.149
They've for a 15 pound or so,

2807
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.470
you can buy a decent pair of leggings and

2808
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:47.359
for.

2809
01:19:48.209 --> 01:19:49.979
Not much over 30 or 40,

2810
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:52.259
you can get decent synthetic fabrics yes

2811
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.830
yes excellent for keeping warm.

2812
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.339
Yes,

2813
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:55.930
the only one trouble,

2814
01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.450
and even I understand from those who spend a lot of money is

2815
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:01.729
jackets

2816
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:04.069
and leggings make you sweat.

2817
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:05.839
And if it's,

2818
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.459
if you're sweating and it's also raining.

2819
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.830
You don't know which is wettest,

2820
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:12.209
the inside or the outside.

2821
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:13.709
So that hasn't changed because I mean,

2822
01:20:13.779 --> 01:20:17.069
presumably before when you had just nothing but wool to keep you warm,

2823
01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:17.500
that was.

2824
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.580
Sometimes I think if you can have several layers of wool,

2825
01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:24.680
but then of course if it's mild,

2826
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.399
like it's been these last,

2827
01:20:26.939 --> 01:20:30.379
the last 4 night walks were so mild we're in shirt sleeves virtually.

2828
01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:34.000
That is one trouble that they haven't overcome.

2829
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.870
But I I like the snow because you don't sweat quite so much then and

2830
01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:40.089
you're prepared for it.

2831
01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:42.339
Perhaps it's because you've got more woollen on when

2832
01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:44.479
it's snow and you don't sweat so much.

2833
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:45.270
hm,

2834
01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:46.339
yeah,

2835
01:20:46.419 --> 01:20:47.540
but very different I'm sure.

2836
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.750
Excellent.

2837
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:49.939
Well,

2838
01:20:50.069 --> 01:20:51.700
I'm sure we could go on talking forever.

2839
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:54.709
If you don't mind,

2840
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:57.750
you can come and see me another time if you can think of other things.

2841
01:20:58.509 --> 01:20:58.910
As I say,

2842
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.799
there's so,

2843
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.589
so much.

2844
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:01.580
It's such a,

2845
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:03.109
such a big,

2846
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:04.089
I don't know.

2847
01:21:05.839 --> 01:21:05.970
Yeah,

2848
01:21:06.009 --> 01:21:06.200
I mean,

2849
01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.319
I've got 9000 odd slides in my,

2850
01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.609
I had to buy a separate wardrobe to put them in.

2851
01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:12.850
They're not all Dartmoor,

2852
01:21:12.930 --> 01:21:15.850
but I suppose 2 to 3000 must be Dartmoor.

2853
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:16.609
Then,

2854
01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:16.959
um,

2855
01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:18.290
this is a kind of.

2856
01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:19.229
Uh,

2857
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:19.939
you know,

2858
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:20.540
uh,
